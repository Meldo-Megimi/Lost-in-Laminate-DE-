:: Lift Chin [Debt]
(set: $debt to it + 20)

"Excellent," the servant grins.  "The 20 credit charge will been added to your account.  Now, allow me to assist."

She approaches the side of the bed, placing one knee upon it to loom over you.  It's impossible to ignore her chest made so visible beneath the violet material.

Your gag is not locked, and removing it simply requires the necessary straps be undone.  Pulling it free, a trail of drool lingers from the ball to your tongue before it snaps.  Carefully the servant sets it aside, her gaze returning to you again.

"Now, how may I assist?"

[["Thank you, I need the rest of my restraints undone!"->She Unlocks]]
[["I need answers!"]]


:: "I need answers!"
"I'm afraid that is not entirely within my capacity to give," she replies, gently pushing a bit of your blonde hair from your eyes.  "We are a small establishment, and I will be required back at the front desk shortly.  You will need to stop there to check out, so perhaps we can talk at length then?"

She looks down the long expanse of your exposed body, her smile returning.  "For now, would I be correct to assume you need your restraints to be undone?"

[["Yes."->She Unlocks]]


:: She Unlocks
The servant nods.  "I understand.  Once again, I am required to inform you that a charge to your account would be made to end your bondage early.  Another 30 credits."

[["Ugh, fine, just get me out!"]]


:: "Ugh, fine, just get me out!" [Debt]
(set: $debt to it + 30)
(set: $debtHelp to true)
"Your total charge for this interaction is now (print: $debt) credits," she chimes, still smiling.  We appreciate your business.  One moment."

Reaching up, she begins to undo your restraints, starting at your wrists.  Freed, you're able to begin pulling off the cuffs themselves as she moves to your ankles.  It takes only a few more moments for your ordeal to finally conclude.  

"Done," the servant concludes, rising from the bed to press her hand against the clock controls atop the nightstand.  The self-unlock command rolls down to zero, then terminates in a flash of red.

"Checkout time is less than an hour away," the servant continues.  "Please collect your things and join me at the front counter when you are ready."

She does not linger, exiting through the only door.  You're left in her wake.  Naked, perhaps ashamed, but freed.

[[It's time to look around.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: LOOKING AROUND
<img src="img/NGiox2N.png" width="75%" height="75%">

You move to the center of the room, turning in a slow circle as you look upon the scene of your short-term amnesia.  You're on Torei, you came here to make a deal-- that's pretty much all you know.  There has to be something here to fill in the gaps!

The room itself is as white and pristine as you saw from your vantage upon the bed.  Furnishings are few and far between, providing a slick, modern look.  It also helps make your search much easier, allowing those few things that did not belong to stick out all the more clearly.

[[The glass device over there, discarded on the chair.->Hotel Glass]]
[[The items on the nightstand, I will search those.->Hotel Nightstand]]
[[There is a brochure of some sort on the table over there.->Hotel Table]]
[[Perhaps turning on the TV will provide some information?->Hotel TV]]
[[A bathroom is attached, I should explore that.->Hotel Bathroom]]
(If: $unlockdoor and $memloss is true)[[[With your small collection of cards, you could now leave.->Leave Correct]]](else:)[[Forget this, I need to LEAVE NOW!->Hotel Leave]]


:: Hotel Nightstand
The nightstand follows the general decorating rules whomever designed this room had landed upon: smooth lines, bright white, little extraneous decoration.  Projected against the wall the clock still marked time, but your focus falls upon the four items below it.  All are small rectangular cards, splayed in a fan-like fashion, but that's where the similarities end.

The first is an Aekoran identification passcard, your own image printed upon the front.  Various identifying features are noted underneath, alongside an expiration date of late tonight.  It appears your time on Torei had been drawing to an end.  The most prominent component of the card, however, is the bright red lettering along the top: **FREEWOMB**.
(set: $Status to 1)(set: $showstatus to true)(set: $unlockdoor to true)
The second card is actually a ticket for an ascent of the planet's space elevator, the Way Up.  Prepaid, and dated for midnight tonight.  Only your name is listed.

The third is a hotel keycard, obviously linked to your room. It's broken in half, the holostrip along the back missing a good chunk.  By itself, this probably wouldn't work.

The final card is more of an enigma.  Rectangular and card like, the material is smooth and reflective.  There are no words, nothing besides a black expanse that encapsulated the entire thing.  Flipping it over, you recognize your own handwriting in a white pen:

*'Tomorrow.  Dusk.  The deal is on.  I can't...'*

The words seem to sit uneasily upon the card, droplets of ink upon a midnight pond.  And... is that movement?

[[What's the Way Up, again?->Elevator II]]
[[Examine the black card more closely.->Black Card]]


:: Hotel Table
The table is clinically white, like much of the room.  Picking up the brochure, you see that it's for a hotel of some sort-- that it was for the very building in which you stand is made clear as soon as you recognize the decor of one of the rooms pictured on the front.

Apparently you're staying at Diarch's Choice, a small hotel located on the outskirts of Grand Aekora, the capital of the Ringdom of Aekora.  Amenities include prompt room service, on-site complimentary Wardrobe devices, a wide selection of wines, and what's referred to as 'secure slave storage'.

Mention of the Wardrobe machine at least perks your interest, even if the description confuses.  It appears to be a public closet of some sort?  At least it would improve upon your current nudity.

It's outside, down the hallway and to the right.
(Set: $Wardrobe to true)
[[You should look around some more.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: Hotel TV
Retrieving the remote from the floor, this time you ignore the large red button along the top labeled //Room Service// and instead settle for a simpler option: //On.//

The large mirror reveals itself to be the television as well once the silvery facade fades, replaced instead by a news channel.  A primly dressed woman in glossy red form-fitting material smiles into the camera, a collar pulled tight around her throat boldly proclaiming her to be 'Property of TNN'.

"Welcome back to the Torean News Network," she greets, as bright and chipper as her outfit.  "As always, my name is Anna Karis and these are your top stories for the Ringdom of Aekora."

The camera flickers, the canned introduction replaced by a recording of the same woman, sitting slightly differently.  It must be presumed they produce customized programs for each region of Torei.

"The Prime Markets are once again trending towards a record year, as imports from the elevator-adjacent Ringdoms continue to increase.  First time indenture rates have increased by 3% among leading sectors, and forecasts expect the boom to only continue as travel to Torei expands further."

[[Keep Watching.->TV2]]
[[Turn off the TV, and look elsewhere.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: Hotel Bathroom
Padding into the bathroom you're met with a small room, walls and ceiling covered in albaster tiles.  A sonic shower, the sort that used compressed sound waves to pull dirt and grime from the body without water, occupies one corner.  Another mirror covers the wall, while a small door of some sort is found opposite-- a sleeve visible, caught in the mechanism!

[[Finally, clothes!->Bath Chute]]
[[You should really check yourself in the mirror.->Bath Mirror]]
(if: $debtShower is false)[[[A quick shower would do you good.->Hotel Shower]]]
[[You decide to return to the larger room instead.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: Hotel Leave
You make for the door, ready to leave whatever happened in this room behind.  It's only upon approaching the door that you realize you're still very much nude, and who *knows* what awaits beyond that portal.  Your room may be full of mysteries, but you had least had come to grips with it.  A brash rush into the world beyond seems ill-advised.

[[You are right, I'll look around again.->LOOKING AROUND]]
[[No, I'm leaving NOW.->Early Exit]]


:: TV2
The woman shifts her papers, the cuffs upon her wrists glinting in the studio lights.

"Moving on, following the dust storm arriving this afternoon, expect at least another three days of sunshine for your local forecast.  The trend from the polar AIs to reduce cloud production continues to result in an unnaturally clear spring, with some concern rising from the Lichen Belt regarding water shortages.  Historical analysis has led experts to assure those affected that the AIs vary their production seemingly at random, but never enough to endanger crop yields..."

[[Keep Watching.->TV3]]
[[Turn off the TV, and look elsewhere.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: TV3 [Debt]
Another shifting of the papers, as the chipper tone turns more serious.

"And for our final item, Torei News Network would like to remind our viewers that the two week overlap between last year's Slave Codes and this year's revisions has ended.  While most adjustments to the Codes are minor, of significance this year are those changes regarding assistance provided to runaway slaves: penalties up to and including enslavement have been doubled.  Non-interaction clauses with polar Daemons have also been strengthened.  By Diarchs' decree, this is Anna Karis for Torei News Network, signing off."  

A good bit of time has passed.
(set: $debt to it + 20) (set: $debtTV to true)
[[Turn off the TV, and look elsewhere.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: Bath Chute
Moving to the door you grab the sleeve, the material synthetic wool, in a deep emerald color.  Holding it so that it wouldn't slip away, you open the door, revealing a chute of some sort-- and the charred end of the sleeve, where it had once undoubtedly been a full shirt.

You've found a garbage chute, you realize quickly.  And probably the last evidence of your clothing.  Did someone burn your clothing?  Did you?  Why would you do that?

[[You wish you could remember.->Hotel Bathroom]]


:: Bath Mirror
Stepping up to the mirror, you lean in, examining your reflection with a discerning eye.  Honestly... you could look much worse, especially for one suffering from such a case of short-term amnesia.

Natural aesthetics certainly help.  By any standard, you're quite beautiful.  High cheekbones, full lips, a nose upturned just //so.//  Your blonde hair is a bit all over the place, but the way it falls upon your shoulders and down your back remains alluring.  Your eyes are piercing as well, so very green.

And you're not hurt, of that you can be sure.  Checking your nude form over, you look for puncture marks, wounds, anything to explain your lost memories.  You find nothing, your skin smooth and unmolested.  

[[Is there something resting in the sink?->Mem Loss]]
[[There is nothing more to see here  Step back.->Hotel Bathroom]]


:: Hotel Shower
You approach the shower stall, its frosted glass door opening with a smooth pull.  It certainly will feel good to allow the machine to do its work.

Stepping up to the small console that controls the shower, you realize the shortest recommended setting is for a good twenty minutes.  Are you in a hurry to leave?

[[Nope, let's do this.->Take Shower]]
[[Yes! You better not.->Hotel Bathroom]]


:: Take Shower [Debt Late]
(set: $debt to it + 50)
(set: $debtShower to true)
The feeling is nothing short of wonderful.  Once the machine starts, the world beyond, the confusion, your lost memories, everything-- it all fades away.  Replaced by a warm //hum//, the shower coaxing the dirt and grime from you, as readily as anything worrying.  Time slips away as well, gliding away with each rolling vibration that emanates from the machine.  But it cannot go forever, and indeed, the automated timer does eventually run out. 

You spent a considerable bit of time, but you are refreshed-- it *must* be worth it.

[[Return to the Bathroom->Hotel Bathroom]]


:: Early Exit
The door is locked.

Shit.  You really should have seen this coming.  There must be a keycard around here somewhere.

[[Panic solves nothing.  Keep looking around.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: Elevator II
The memory is cloaked in a web of blackened synapses, lying at the very edge of the abyss that you recognize as your short term memory, but fragments do come through.  You're seated upon a plush bench seat, hand pressed to the glass of the capsule roaring downward towards a planet that stretches towards the horizon.  Far less convenient then landing directly, but you know that isn't possible.  Men defied the Gods of the this world once, but do so again at their own peril.  This is the only way.

[[Of course.  Now that black card, is it moving?->Black Card]]


:: Black Card
The surface of the black card shifts, a pond disturbed. Equally obsidian letters rise, hardly visible until you turn the card, utilizing its own glossy reflection to view what had arisen from the depthless deep.  Words.

//356 Cross Street, Grand Aekora.  Dusk.//

The words linger, but only momentarily.  As readily as they had emerged, the letters eventually sink back into the abyss.  Running your finger over the surface of the black card returns only the sensation of a smooth surface, unblemished besides your own comparably uncivilized scrawl.  To call the experience eerie would be to understate the situation greatly.

[[There is a story here, though.  Focus.  Put this all together.]]


:: Leave Correct
Finally, you carefully hold the pieces of your keycard together.  Pressing them to the door, a purple light briefly flashes and the door's lock audibly clicks.  You're out.

And still nude.  Glancing back at your room, you know you were thorough.  Whatever clothes you had come to Torei with, they're gone.  Making for the front desk seems an obvious solution, if a bit embarrassing.  Given the planet's reputation, certainly your situation could not be unique.

You open the door and pass through, cards clutched in your hand.  The hallway outside maintains the clean aesthetic your room had demonstrated, but the color scheme had changed-- here purple dominates, the floor a dark shade, the carpeting below something akin to periwinkle.  Thankfully, the hallway is quiet, without a soul in sight.

You look left, then right.

(if: $Wardrobe is true)[[[You remember that mention of a 'Wardrobe Device' being somewhere nearby, out your door and to the right.  Worth a try.->Wardrobe I]]]
[[Light pours into a larger room visible at the end of the wall to your left.  That has to be the front desk.  Make for it.->NudeFront]]
[[The way to your right appears to end abruptly further down the way, but you could still head that direction.->Wardrobe Alt]]


:: There is a story here, though.  Focus.  Put this all together.
Competing narratives become apparent.  On one hand, you have your ticket for the Way Up, and the expiration of your passcard.  You must have been planning to leave tomorrow.

On the other hand, the black card and your troubled white scrawl.  The card had given a date and place, that's obvious.  You're a prospector, this *must* have been the deal you came to make.  The contact you could not recall, a meeting scheduled to acquire the technology you traveled all this way to acquire.  But what of what you had written yourself?

*'Tomorrow.  Dusk.  The deal is on.  I can't...'*

A warning?  If only you could remember!  And what of the predicament you had awoken to?  Bound and gagged, perhaps by your own hand.  With a self-release timer counting down, intended to *just* overshoot dusk.  That would mean you would have missed the meet for the deal, but would have given you enough time to make the trip back to the elevator.  

(if: $memloss is true)[The Mem-Burn you found in the bathroom provided further evidence of a concerted effort to prevent your attending the deal.  Bound and gagged, forced to wait until tomorrow, unable to recall *anything*?  You would have missed it for sure.]

Had you tried to prevent yourself from making the deal?  Why go to such lengths?  

(if: $memloss is true)[Answers do not come, but at least you have both portions of the keycard.  Leaving your room is now possible.]

[[Collect the cards, and move back towards the center of the room.->LOOKING AROUND]]


:: Mem Loss
Reaching down, you indeed find something: a crumpled bit of packaging.  Straightening out the cardboard, a smaller chunk of plastic slides out.  You recognize it as a stereotypical hotel keycard, or at least a fragment of one.  The holostrip along the back is broken, by itself it wouldn't function.
(set: $memloss to true)
It's the packaging that's more intriguing, however.  *Mem-Burn*, it labels itself as you read the fine print aloud.  "WARNING: active ingredients will cause memory loss ranging from temporary to permanent, depending on dose.  Use with CAUTION."

The package is empty, but at least one part of your mystery situation becomes clear.  This has to be why your short-term memory was little more than a gaping wound, black and empty, like a missing tooth.  Why would you have done this to yourself?  

(If: $unlockdoor is true)[It had to be tied to the collection of cards you had found upon the nightstand.  Bound and gagged, your memory wiped clean-- had you not broken free early, you would have undoubtedly missed the meeting the black card promised.  Troubling.  At the very least, you have both portions of the keycard now.  Leaving your room is now possible.]

[[There is nothing more to see here.  Hold onto the keycard fragment, and step back.->Hotel Bathroom]]


:: Wardrobe I
The door you find is as undecorated as the rest, but it's label promises the clothing you so clearly need.  *Wardrobe.*  You also notice a small indicator below the handle, quietly proclaiming the room was *Unoccupied.*  Perfect.  Glancing once more down the hallway, your naked form passes through the portal as the door opens before you.

If you were expecting something akin to a closet, what you enter into leaves you sorely disappointed.  There are no shelves, no hangings racks with textiles and outfits.  Only a sterile room greets you, quite claustrophobic given how small it is, and reminding you a bit of a bathroom given the tiles on the walls and a drain visible on the floor.  Several of the tiles are oddly shaped, the gap between them and their neighbors larger.  On the far wall, a touch-screen panel flickers to life.

*Welcome to this Wardrobe Device.  Please approach for ocular scan and identification.*

[[Strange.  Examine one of the oddly shaped tiles.->Tile Check]]
[[Approach the touch-screen panel.->Wardrobe II]]


:: NudeFront [Debt]
<img src="img/G0lGB6M.png" width="55%" height="55%">
(set: $methelp2 to true)(set: $debt to it + 30)(set: $debtFrontNude to true)
Advancing quickly down the hallway, you approach a clear glass window, a door set into it.  It's hard not to expect another setback as you give the door's handle a yank, that would just be your luck, but it swings open with only the barest effort.  

Passing through subjects you to natural light for the first time since your awakening, an experience that leaves you dazed and blinking.  Your eyes do eventually adapt, revealing a cozy room, complete with a woman seated behind a semi-transparent desk.

(if: $methelp is true)[The violet, semi-transparent top-- that smile, you've met this woman before.  It's the same servant who had answered your call for room service, and her perchant for amused looks clearly had not left her.  The chain run between her wrists clinks softly as she lifts them, a gesture of greeting set alongside another appraising look of your nude body.  "Ah, hello again, Ma'am.  I see you are still enjoying yourself, but I am required to inform you that Aekora in general and this establishment in particular does feature robust public decency laws and attendant fines.  Your violation has been noted.  We can discuss that and whatever else you desire further, but perhaps first you would like to get dressed?  There is a Wardrobe device back down the way you came, past your room."](else:)[The woman is somewhere near your own age, wearing a hotel worker's uniform-- but of an outlandish style and cut.  Rendered in slick, glossy material, the woman's uniform is utterly tight.  Her pencil skirt hugs wide hips, while a corset embraces her midsection, allowing a violet bodice that emerges above.  She's quite busty, and the purple material is semi-transparent, allowing a clear view of her pierced nipples.  Her brightly painted lips open as she greets you.  "Good day, Ma'am. I am required to inform you that Aekora in general and this establishment in particular does feature robust public decency laws and attendant fines.  Your violation has been noted.  We can discuss that and whatever else you desire further, but perhaps first you would like to get dressed?  There is a Wardrobe device back down the way you came, past your room."]

[["U-Uh, right..." Find that Wardrobe.->Wardrobe I]]


:: Wardrobe Alt
Exploring down the darker portion of the corridor, you pass several more doors, each numbered in the same manner as the one you just left.  Obviously further hotel rooms.

Reaching the end where the hallway ends at a blank wall, you're just about to turn around cursing your foolishness when you realize the final door is labeled differently.  Instead of a number, it features a label: *Wardrobe.*

[[Finally, some clothes!  Enter the door.->Wardrobe I]]
[[I shouldn't be exploring, not in the nude!  I should try and find that front desk.  Head back down the hallway.->NudeFront]]


:: Tile Check
Ignoring the bright glow of the panel nearby, you instead approach one of the larger tiles built into the sidewall.  It's shaped like a trapezoid, a far cry from the squares that surround it.  Pressing your hand against it, you feel a bit of movement, as if the entire thing was designed to perhaps slide out or in on command.  Given that a half dozen other strangely shaped tiles can be counted at a quick glance, you feel a slight chill run down your spine.  Just what was this tiny room intended for?

[[It's time to check that touch display.->Wardrobe II]]
[[I'm getting the hell out of here.->Wardrobe Bad Exit]]


:: Wardrobe II
Crossing the room isn't much of an effort, you can barely manage a step before bumping up against the wall opposite.  The bright display screen greets you with a sudden flash, your eyes watering and several moments of frantic blinking required before you can look again at the small screen.

*Thank you for staying at Diarch's Choice Hotel.  This is a Class III Laminate Wardrobe Device, and is capable of manufacturing from custom ROMs of a Class III nature.  If you have a custom ROM you wish to utilize, please insert your clip now.*

It waits several seconds, the final line of instruction blinking.  Once it becomes apparent you barely have an understanding of what it meant, much less a 'custom ROM', the machine continues.

*You have not chosen to utilize a custom ROM.  Would you like to browse our preallocated assortment of available laminate outfits?*

[[Yes, finally!  Outfits!  Clothes!  Select that.->Wardrobe III]]
[[I think... maybe I should be getting out of here.  Make for the door.->Wardrobe Bad Exit]]


:: Wardrobe Bad Exit
You bite down on your fear, but cannot shake the *flight* reaction your instincts settle upon.  Turning around in the small, stall-like room, you reach for the stainless steel door handle... and it doesn't turn.

The display panel on the far wall momentarily changes, providing an explanation as you try not to panic: 

*Nudity detected.  Aekoran law requires all slaves and women of freewomb status meet basic decency considerations before departure.  Please explore this Wardrobe device's catalog at your convenience, and select a complimentary free design of your choice!*

The cheery message retreats, and you're left without much of a choice.

The text slides upwards, replaced by a message up top and five tantalizing options listed below it.

The screen displays a model wearing the selected outfit.  It's sleek, form-fitting, and rendered entirely in a material labeled as *laminate*.  Even in the simulated light, the design seems to sparkle with the metallic hues embedded in the glossy material.

The screen displays a model wearing the selected outfit.  It's sleek, form-fitting, and rendered entirely in a material labeled as *laminate*.  The suit is also clearly semi-transparent, the thickened black strip between the legs that contained a zipper providing a modicum of decency, but it's hard to imagine wearing something from throat to toes that covered *less.* 

Accessories are listed as a set of black wrist-gloves, five inch heeled stiletto boots, and the pictured upper body harness, waist belt, and thigh cuffs.  Those last three are marked as 'restraint ready'.

The screen displays a model wearing the selected outfit.  It's sleek, form-fitting, and rendered entirely in a material labeled as *laminate*.  The primary coloration is black, but Torean-script words are boldly emblazoned along the arms and thighs.  Translation indicates the name brand of a mid-tier Torean slave trading firm, as well as inviting others to 'submit to advert-wear to earn credits!'  It appears terribly degrading.

Accesories are listed as the pictured corset, the design featuring 'real steel' boning custom-measured to both fit the wearer and match brand requirements, as well as the pictured shoes.  Those are labeled as 'ballet', and are clearly of a design that would make even standing upright a challenge-- much less walking!

Matching makeup is included, and the display is quick to remind you that wearing this outfit would automatically award 50 credits to your account.

Unlike some of the other available options, this design is at least somewhat comparable to offworld norms-- if one ignored the glossy material used, and tight cut of the shirt above.

Accessories are listed as the pictured pair of four inch open-front pumps, and the peplum skirt around the waist.

<img src="img/7hkuAc4.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

The screen displays several models wearing the selected outfit, their uniformity only broken by their individual physical proportions.  It's sleek, form-fitting, and rendered entirely in a material labeled as *laminate*.  Midnight black and clearly uncomfortable to wear, the oufits nevertheless spark something deep within your subconscious.  A lost memory, perhaps?  No matter how much you pull at that strand, nothing surfaces.

Flashing brightly, a warning is appended to this outfit: *This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

Accessories are listed as the pictured corset, heels, regulation mask, posture collar, and (non-pictured) inserts.  The corset is noted as featuring 'real steel' boning, and is custom-measured to match standard Torean expectations of functional corsetry.  So too does the posture collar proudly proclaim its core as being 'real steel', as well as meeting all Aekoran slave law requirements.  The heels are listed as six inches in height, with one inch platforms.  The mask is simply described as rated for Torean storms, as well as regulating oxygen intake.  And the inserts?  Those are described as front and rear installation, custom-molded for maximum stimulation.  All devices feature 10 hour self-release locks.

Makeup is included as well, while the price is listed as requiring an extra 150 credit fee.  You absolutely cannot understand why anyone would pay *more* for such things to be inflicted upon them.  Yet looking back up at those models, perhaps there is something that yearns within, to add a fifth  uniformally adorned and restrained woman to that lineup...

The display winks out of existence, and for the briefest of moments you are left to ponder your decision.  Your revery is broken by the quiet whirl of machines moving, however, as you notice the various strangely shaped tiles along the walls kicking out.  Appendages emerge, mechanical arms of several different kinds.  You don't have time to catalog them, hell, you barely have time to gasp before they seize you.  At wrist and ankle, and around the throat, padded rings snap against and then around your soft flesh.  Then the grip, legs forced apart as your arms are lifted above your head.

You pull against the restraining arms, eyes wide as other devices emerge from the walls.  Compared to your earlier experience on your own bed, these at least have some give-- your first yank of the arm nearly sends you tumbling over, but the arm momentarily loses grip on you entirely.

:: Blue Confirm2
The urge is there to close your eyes, as if ignorance could prevent what was about to occur.  But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, before the device descends.

Nozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past your neck.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei's all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your metallic blue suit is quiet literally printed on, the ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  Your black gloves are printed, while a longer period is required for the Wardrobe to build up the necessary thickness required of your eight points of restraint.  Those are affixed at ankle, wrist, bicep, waist, and throat.  Again the metal hardpoints are installed last, emerging fully formed from hidden storage components.  A far less expensive option then flash-casting steel.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.

Almost as an afterthought, the promised makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, the corners twinkling with flecks of metallic blue to match your suit.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a dark blue, the white of your teeth blinding against them as you gasp slightly.

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

Torei's all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although most of their effort is focused upon the design work of the advertisements and designs now intended to grace your body.  Bold lines run from the white ring around the suit's collar, down your shoulders.  Other similar designs are placed upon your biceps and near the knee.  The largest are those on your hips (blocky letters spelling out a slaving firm's name), your chest (which features their vaguely triangular logo), and your back (which encourages others to 'submit to advert-wear today!).  A final arm lingers between your legs, working on the zipper located there, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused entirely at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, towering stilleto heels being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.  You are now permanently *en pointe*, or as anyone would immediately notice: on your toes.

Almost as an afterthought, the promised makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.

Torei's all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constained by your bodice.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molton laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.

Almost as an afterthought, the promised makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.

The urge is there to close your eyes, as if ignorance could prevent what was about to occur.  Why *had* you chosen the most expensive, most intensive option?  But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, waiting only for an attendant arm to strategically place your blonde hair before the device descends.

Nozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past the crown of your head.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Holes at your mouth, nose, and eyes are quickly excised.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei's all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.

Given the intended production of a full scale regulation mask, the promised makeup is applied next.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened and your eyelashes extended, producing an alluring effect.  And your lips are now a bright red coloration, an interesting detail given what comes next.

That would be your mask, listed for *breath regulation*.  You already have been provided with a thin hood much akin to the rest of your catsuit, but this secondary mask is much thicker, several armatures working together to forge it upon your face.  A handful of metal components are integrated as well, but your field of vision had already been restricted enough that you barely notice.  Indeed, before you know it a curved glass panel is being placed just before your eyes, the laminate seals along the edge flash-cooling.

Your next breath, the first within your new enclosed environment, is thus harder.  *Much* harder.  You gasp, trying to suck in enough oxygen-- only for your corset's constriction to assert itself.  It's a devious combination, one you would have almost certainly cursed had not the machine (and thus your own focus) already shifted elsewhere.

Several attending arms move back up to your throat, casting thick laminate in yet another layer until several steel segments (much like those trimming your waist) are sunk into the material.  The Wardrobe was ensuring your head remained up, but you're hit with the immediate sensation that was no longer necessary-- the collar would ensure your posture going forward.

Yet another componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall stilleto heels and a thick platform for your toes being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.

You take a deep breath, watching the shiny blue material covering your chest gently rise and fall.  The sensation is almost otherwordly, light pressure upon your body from to toe to throat, a lover's embrace you cannot escape.  Excepting the zipper between your legs, there is no point of entrance, no direct break in the experience.  Only smooth laminate, and the sweet scent of lingering rubber.

Running a hand down the slick material reveals laminate to laminate contact to be almost frictionless.  It's almost too easy to forget your own hand as it glides along your hip.  The gentle *click* of the metal studded into your cuffs provide a more consistent narrative, as does the more authoritative snap of your heeled boot as you shift a bit in the Wardrobe's small confines.

No further warning is given.  With sudden explosive action, the inserts drive forward.  They find the waiting holes readily enough, then twist, as if screwing their way into your body.  Despite yourself a moan escapes your ruby red (and masked) lips as you're pierced from both ends.  They plunge further, and further-- your mind screams for an end, your body assures you it cannot take anymore.  Yet it does.  Still further, further, further...

Until you're hilted on the ends, hips swaying minutely as you try fruitlessly to adapt to the sensation.  It may be amusing in restrospect, if you ever allow yourself to remember this moment, how gentle the final arm is that pulls your zipper closed again.  A small padlock on the end is almost an afterthought.

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

You collapse to your knees, the short distance an altogether new experience as your inserts shift deep within your cunt and rear.  Again you moan, this time frustrated with yourself as you try to focus, breathing hard against the stricture of your mask.  It takes several minutes, but eventually you find yourself watching the tight, glossy material covering your chest gently rise and fall.  Your posture is ensured by the corset, while also making each breath a bit of an effort, at least until your body adapted.

Running a hand down the slick material reveals laminate to laminate contact to be almost frictionless.  It's almost too easy to forget your own hand as it glides along your thigh-- as a strong compulsion draws the limb inward, towards the nexus of your legs.  You resist... for the moment.  Instead you struggle back to your feet, biting your lip, pelvis thrusting slightly in reaction to the sensations within.  Your heels do not help matters, the effect of being forced onto your toes one that will certainly take some effort to combat.

No.  One last accessory remains, having been listed on the original selection as... **inserts**.

Adrenaline shoots through your system as the Wardrobe realigns itself again, this time positioning two large arms, one before your lower torso, the other just behind it.  Long, thick cylinder-like forms begin to extrude from the arms, taking the shape of what you recognize quite immediately as masculine physiology.  As they work, another more nimble arm presses forward, seizing upon the only zipper on your suit.  A mathematically simple arc carries it down between your legs, exposing a set of holes matched so perfectly to the now fully formed dildos.  Your body tenses as a syrup-like lubricant is applied to each.

You pull hard against the arms still holding you, doing anything you could to pull your womanhood away from the lewd phallus all but ready to plunge inside.  Perhaps if you had *really* tried before, you could have escaped the Wardrobe's clutches.  Now?  Your mask ensures the effort quickly leaves you breathless, while your corset and collar prevent much in the way of squirming.

And that's ignoring completely the sudden snap of electricty against your backside, a lingering arm providing harsh collective action.  You collapse back into your restraints as the display flashes its disapprovement.

Natural light stabs sharp lines onto the marble floor of the small atrium you emerge into, columns at all four corners rising to a recessed ceiling very similar to the one within your room.  Another glass door clearly leaves outside, but blinking away the overexposure from that portal, you instead turn towards the only other object of note: a woman, seated behind a transparent desk.

(if: $methelp is true)["Hello again!" She greets, smiling.  It's the woman from before, perhaps the hotel's only employee.

She's quite busty, and the purple material is semi-transparent, allowing a clear view of her pierced nipples.  Her brightly painted lips open as she greets you.  "Good day, Ma'am!

Your rational mind certainly has some questions.  Perhaps the first is what compelled you to choose this particular design from that Wardrobe device.  But more readily?  Why you can't stop the fingers that slide along your corset, downward, below your naval.

The answer?  Your body knows what it wants.  It ignores your currently quite public position in the middle of a hallway as your legs give out, falling to your knees upon the floor.  Your more sensible hand moves to your mask, trying weakly to push it off, to free yourself from the strict breath regulation.  Your other, however, traces tantalizingly along the base of your front insert.  Hidden by the locked zipper, but accessible by mere touch nevertheless.

You moan quietly, eyes closing as you lean back onto your haunches...

It doesn't matter what you *think* you want.  Your body knows what to do.

Nimble gloved fingers press into the laminate between your legs, shifting the cock buried there as a hiss of pleasure works through your mask regulators.  You can barely breath, but that's hardly necessary, not as waves of pleasure begin to roll up against your womanhood.  Overzealous motivations at first drive you into quite a bit of fumbling, but it doesn't take long for you to settle into a steady rhythm, pressing your thumb hard against the front plug as you lean further, driving the rear one into the back of your heel.  Somewhere along the way the hand at your mask travels downward, finding a far more *useful* purpose at your own breast, playing with the hardened bud as you wantonly pleasure yourself.

The waves of ecstasy rise, eventually overtoppign you in a final tsunami of sensation.  Do you even truly experience it?  Already an amnesiac, you're not sure on this one-- all you recall is the sweet pulses from your cunt dissolving into static, everything going blank...

Until you rouse, a pile of black laminate gasping on the hotel hallway floor.  It takes you several long moments before you can pull yourself back to your knees, and from there your feet.  Your plugged cunt's aching desire had momentarily fled, but you are treated to the sensation of your own bodily juices shifting within.

"First off, your keycard?"

With a bit of reluctance, you slide the twined pieces across the transparent desk to her.  She eyes the broken card for a moment, but her smile never fades.

"Well," she notes, collecting the pieces and tossing them in a nearby trash bin.  "You will be charged for keycard replacement, I hope that is acceptable, ma'am?  It's only 20 credits.

(set: $AskAddress to true)
It takes only a few moments for her to pull up the relevent information.  "Ah!  Here it is.  Seems to be a... nightclub, of some sort?  Deep in downtown Grand Aekora, though.

She seems to be waiting for a response, but you're not sure you even have one.  Laws for women?

Eventually she just continues.  "Well we do, ma'am.  There are a *lot*.  Way too many for me to go over.  Usually I just advise freewomb guests like yourself to always keep your identification permit with you, and to be careful traveling after dark.  They're very strict about curfew, and really, its best to just try and avoid the Officers altogether."

"Good question, ma'am!  That is an important one to know, here on Torei.  Technically there are two classes of women here on Torei, but I really think of them as being three.

Usually technically freewombs, but serving contracts or working off debt.  There are lots of ways to fall into debt on Torei, especially for offworlders who aren't careful.

The woman nods, a gloved hand rising to the band secured around her neck.  It's almost unnecessary, given the chain also linking her wrists.

"Yes ma'am. Since I sold myself once I hit majority.  It can be hard for offworlders to understand, but it is all I looked forward to.  There is security in a collar you can't get elsewhere on Torei, as a woman."

She leans across the table, once again eyeing your full enclosure suit.  "But I came to *like* it, too.  Losing control... it's something else..."

Her smile is wide.  "Isn't it.?"

You take a deep breath, trying hard to ignore your plugs.

"Yes!" The girl replies.  "My Master, the proprietor of this establishment, understands that given the frequency of our guests not born to Torei, registering a proper debt contract with the Ministry of Truants to collect on your account would be bothersome for all parties involved.  Instead, I am authorized to write off portions of your outstanding debt if you accept certain... temporary strictures.

"Right..." the servant muses, collecting herself.  She takes several moments to type into her computer, clearly cross-checking with the debt relief list you had just explored with her.

With a flourished finger pressing down on her computer's INPUT button, the girl looks back up to you.  "Alright!  The Wardrobe Device is loaded with the debt relief measures we discussed.  Simply head back and allow it to scan you again. (if: $Level is 4)[It will perform everything except your punishment, return here for that.].

The servant scrolls down on her display screen.  "The second level of debt forgiveness requires the installation of a time-released armbinder.  I imagine, given the Mem-Burn, an explanation will be required?"

She doesn't wait for a response, seemingly eager to provide.

"The last of our *standard* debt relief levels is only for extensive debtors... such as yourself, ma'am."  Its clear she's trying to be respectful, but the ground she must cover makes that difficult.

"Here on Torei, you must understand that debt is something taken very seriously.  Every day freewombs such as yourself find their debts outweighing their earning potential.  Bankruptcy inevitably follows, and in such circumstances enslavement is the usual result.  We are prepared to write off your debts regardless, but a more... permanent lesson will be required.  I'm now allowed to say more, not until after installation."

Her eyes return to her console, lips pursed in consideration.  That write-off will take you to (print: $debt).

The servant nods.  "Level four is quite simple.  Given your debt level, you will need to be punished, and this punishment will be recorded so that the hotel can recoup some of our losses on your behalf.  A standard Aekoran corrective action is the application of a riding crop to a debtor, exact placement being at our discretion.  Usually it's the rear.  5 credits will be deducted per strike.  At your remaining balance of... (print: $debt), you're looking at (print: $debt / 5) strikes."

The hallway is much as you left it, the shades of purple, the carpeted floor below.  This time you know exactly where you're going, and it takes only a moment to find yourself before the clean door.  Its still unoccupied, allowing you to open the portal and step back inside.  Again the display screen greets you, another flash of light announcing it had taken an ocular scan.  There the experience changes, the myraid choices from before replaced by a much more straightforward option:

*You are about to submit to the (if: $Level is 1)[Level One] (if: $Level is 2)[Level Two] (if: $Level is 3)[Level Three] (if: $Level is 4)[Level Four] Debt Forgiveness program, as outlined in your initial lease agreement and discussed with this Hotel's owner, or his designated slave(s).  All adjustments made to you during this submission must be maintained for a period of at least twelve hours.*

**DO YOU COMPLY?**

[[Yes.->Debt End III]]


:: Debt End IIB
As you march sullenly back towards the glass door that led to the hotel's rooms, and the Wardrobe Device at the far back, the servant shakes her head.

"Believe me, ma'am-- this is much better then getting a Truant Officer involved."

[["Sure it is..."->Debt End II]]


:: Debt End III
The various arms of the Wardrobe emerge en masse, repeating the procedure you have already undergone once.  Wrists, ankles, and throat are seized, although the presence of your clothing does make it a somewhat gentler experience this time around.

Moving downward in a wave, the Wardrobe begins working on your promised hobble chain.  Instead of working solely in direct steel, it instead uses only a few strategically placed filiments to reinforce the hard-sealed laminate it uses otherwise.  (if: $Blue is true)[The presence of your ankle cuffs are integrated into the design, the metal loops there being used to anchor the chain itself that is finished with a chromed, silvery finish.] (if: $Smoke is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, the black laminate matching those you already wore at your thighs. The chain between them is finished with a chromed, silvery look sure to catch the light as readily as your see-through catsuit.] (if: $Brand is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, the red laminate used matching the design of the logos elsewhere on your body. The chain between them is finished with a white coloration, again coordinating with your adverts.] (if: $Sec is true)[Lacking ankle cuffs, fresh ones are first printed for you, the red laminate worked with slightly flared metal designs for the metal components, coordinating with the rest of your professional attire.

You emerge from the Wardrobe Device for a second time, once again transformed...

...and this time, not alone.  Another guest of the hotel had apparently just exited her room, a woman perhaps near your age (although Torei's medical technologies made it so difficult to tell.)  Her outfit is immaculate, all black laminate with poofed shoulders and tall thigh-high stilletos.  She wears the material, including  smartly fastened corset, with an ease you cannot imagine.  

Reflective, mirror-like glasses hide her gaze, but you cannot help but imagine her staring.  Ruby red lips curl into a smile as she pauses, closing her room's door but otherwise lingering.  After a long moment she gestures for you to pass, the gloved movement as smooth and cool as her half-veiled expression.

[[Just pass her... calmly->Hallway Pass]]


:: Debt End IV
No opportunity for rest is given as the Wardrobe whirls, arms cycling upward as those gripped to your wrists suddenly jerk your arms back.  It isn't a gentle experience.  Given the larger print job, three of the device's appendages begin circling your arms, coating them in the laminate that is quickly flash-set into a tight layer.  Reinforcements are built into the area around your hands to prevent an escape, and so that a large ring can be emplaced-- which, once cooled an armature seizes, demonstrating just how easily you can now be controlled that way.  The final component is the portion that circles around your shoulders and upper chest, anchoring the binder and preventing it from being slipped off easily.

Already your shoulders whine with hints of pain, the position unpracticed.

:: Debt End V
You're hobbled and bound, yet still the Wardrobe moves.  Perhaps you had not intended to rack up a debt as high as it had gotten.  How could you truly have known?  But Torei does not ask for apologies.  It demanded correction, this time of a more pemanent nature then mere bindings-- just as promised.

The device holding onto your armbinder's ring pulls suddenly downward just as your legs are yanked forward.  You're suspended in the air now, back arched, breasts pressing against the laminate cups of your oufit as they're thrust out.  (if: $lave is true or $Brand is true)[Your corset makes the position painful in the extreme.]

It's then that a new armature appears, this one new, at least to your eyes.  Instead of a gripping limb, or a painter-like nozzle, this has something much more sinister: a lancing needle.  Long, silvery... and move mechanically down, towards your breasts.  The protection offered by your outfit is momentarily vacated, solvants being applied that melt the material readily in a steam that fans suck away greedily.  With unnerving precision, the needle is positioned.  There is no fanfare, no warning-- it merely shifts suddenly, one moment waiting beside your nipple, the next pierced straight through it.  

[[You scream.->Debt End VI]]


:: Debt End VI
The Wardrobe device doesn't much care for your reaction.  It does provide a quite fast acting healing agent, undoubtedly a Torean marvel of bioengineering that would have fascinated the Prospector that is your job title, but that seems less a kindness and more simple utilitarianism.  Once healed, a silvery barbell is inserted, your violation now marked by the small silver balls now framing the highlight of your chest.

You hang limply as the procedure is repeated on your other nipple.  Afterward the nozzles return, reapplying the laminate of your suit.  Its as if they had never torn it apart, but the foreign sensations emanating from your chest are a constant reminder...

[[It almost... feels good.->Debt Final]]


:: Hallway Pass
You try to act as confident as the woman appears, the effect so very much like being a model on a runway, even if its for a crowd of one.

Your hobble chain loudly snaps with your first step as it pulls tight, the restricted gait unnatural.  You can manage something more then a shuffle, but its hardly dignified.  (if: $Level is 2 or 3 or 4)[For the first time you realize just how helpless the armbinder has rendered you as well, (if: $Blue or $Slave is true)[the device conspiring with your corset to thrust out your chest and rear.](else:)[the effect of the device on your arms thrusting out your chest and rear.]  Were the woman's midnight clad hands to grab you, its clear you could offer little resistance.]  Yet she doesn't move, merely observing as you make your way past.

No owner is marked upon the thick posture collar, she could certainly see that.]

Once past, you try to put her out of your thoughts,  focusing once more on the passage from hallway to front office.  There the servant waits, expectantly.  

"Wonderful!"

"The only thing we have left to talk about is your departure, then," she notes.  The sound of heeled shoes on the tiled floor draws your attention back towards the hallway, however, where the woman glimpsed earlier emerges.  One hand grips the small purse slung over her shoulder, while the other crosses beneath her chest, supporting a pensive posture as she boldly passes through the Front Office and out the front door.

The servant had paused to watch as well, but her attention returns to you as soon as the front door closes again.  "We were talking about... your departure, correct?"

[["Yes."->Transport II]]


:: Trans Pierce
"Part of the lesson," the girl points out, still behind her desk.  "Is the surprise!  Believe me, they're really not *that* bad."

Her own top, violet see-through laminate, does feature the steel adornments to her nipples quite prominently.  She certainly had to be an expert on the matter, but her enthusiasm for... Torean culture perhaps far exceeded your own.

(if: $Level is 3)[[["I'd just really like to get out of here."->Transport]]]
(if: $Level is 4)[The servant emerges from behind her desk, a long rod-like device of heavy laminate in her hands.  "There is still the matter of your punishment, ma'am."

[[Oh no.->Crop]]]

You shy away, its only natural.  

"Oh, don't be like that," the employee tsk-tsks.  "You've come so far, and you've *earned this.*  Besides, you're technically under slave codes until your debt is cleared.  Any resistance, and I will append additional fees.  That means more applications of the crop, and you already have (print: $debt / 5) to undergo.  Alright?"

She doesn't wait for a response, but instead rises, leaving her desk.  Its only then that you notice the chain descending from the ceiling, in the corner of the office.  Of course she makes for, waiting for you to join her before grabbing the ring on your armbinder tightly.  You nearly lose your balance as she lifts the ring, forcing your arms up, and your head down.  It appears to be a maneuver she's quite well versed in, as she quickly has the ring snapped to the chain.

You're now bent over, arms back and pulled up.  The heels on your boots ensure your rear is neatly displayed, pert rear and rounded thighs gleaming in the light.  

"I am going to apply the crop," she explains.  "Once for every 5 credits you still owe, as we discussed.  It will be your job to count the strikes, aloud.  I would hate to give you too many... or too few. Understood?"

You shift slightly, unable to straighten back up.

"Well then," she smiles.  "Did you have a destination in mind?"

Despite everything you had gone through since leaving your room, the mystery of your waking still stood to be answered.  Had your memory been forcibly wiped, or had you subjected yourself to such an experience?  What could drive you to do such a thing?

Your evidence is as scant as the resources you have available: three measely cards.  The elevator ticket for the Way Up expired tomorrow night, but it promised your one clear chance to free you of Torei forever-- an escape from the humiliation, the bondage, the laminate you had found yourself so readily falling into.

But that would mean abandoning the enigma that was the black card and its promise of a potential deal, your original reason for coming to the planet in the first place.  The wealth that would result from a successful prospecting mission to this planet would remain untapped.  

You could try for both, the black card's rendezvous is planned for tonight, giving you perhaps a day to make your way to the elevator.  But as your third and final card, the one the served as your ID, reminded with the bold red letters stamped across the top... here you were a FREEWOMB first, and there could be so many pitfalls waiting on Torei's streets.

The slave does not hesitate, her riding crop striking out with percussive force.  The heavy duty laminate has some give, but as the rectangular tip licks the glossy material covering your lower rear, pain still blossoms-- sharp and heady. (set: $Strike to it +1) (set: $debt to it - 5)

She doesn't demand much, only the opportunity to slide her laminate fingers up between your legs, rubbing briefly at the zipper covering your cunt.  Your knees shake of their own accord in response, a second-- more hungry-- moan escaping.

:: CUFFS
The girl raises her own chained wrists, then looks to those clasped firmly upon your own body.  "Oh yes," she asserts, readily.  "Certain sorts are required of certain folk, of course, but most anyone can wear some.  Freewombs such as yourself commonly do."

She tips her head back and forth, bangs swaying pendulum like.  "Honestly I didn't expect a woman such as yourself to wear some, but given your financial situation... you did notice the locks on them, right?  They will come off in a few hours.  Aekoran law requires that for any freebies at a Wardrobe.  Ministry of Truants asserts it makes dealing with loiters and vagabonds easier.  They're usually the only sort to wear the free stuff."

It takes her a long moment to gasp.  "Not that I was suggesting anything, ma'am!"

[["None taken, let's just get back to my other questions.->Front Q]]


:: SHOES
The servant shakes her head.  "Afraid not, ma'am.  Did you read all the fine print when you made that selection?"

Her smile returns.  "Probably not.  No one does.  I've been asked about it enough to know that it's in there, though.  Timed locks are included, so you don't go back on your advertising contract.  They're on your corset too, if you haven't noticed.  Not sure why they went with ballets, though.  Usually its offworlders who go for the advert-suits.  And ballets aren't friendly to those sorts at all.  Ooo! Maybe that's part of the advertisement!  You know, seeing an offworlder struggling in ballets, branded with a big slaver's ad?  Makes the better investment clear!"  

She shrugs and you shift from one foot to the other, trying to remain *en pointe* before her.  "Toreans don't go for it because we know it's much more lucrative to sell *yourself* instead of just your clothes for a few hours, ma'am.  That tip is free."

[["Right... let's just get back to my other questions.->Front Q]]


:: MASK
"Can I take a closer look?" She asks in response, gesturing you forward.  After a moment's hesitation you approach, your posture collar ensuring you can't do much as her gloved hands glide along the edges of your mask.  It takes her only a second or two for a conclusion to be reached.

"Sorry, ma'am.  Afraid not.  I guess the latest update removed the regulation valve on the side.  You're in there until the timed locks give out, that's always been standard.  But looks like the recent law revisions decided to make it harder on you."

You step back, heels clicking upon the marble floor as she continues.  It's hard to suppress the moan that comes from your shifting inserts.  "Only thing I can tell you is that design is by far the most common, here in Aekora.  Mostly as a standardized uniform for slaves, but... still.  They put a lot of research into them.  That breath regulator will keep you on the edge, but it won't suffocate you."

[["...great. Let's just get back to my other questions.->Front Q]]


:: Strike Refuse
You pull against your restraints, unable to take the punishment.
(set: $debt to it + 5)
Behind you, arm readied for another blow, the servant shakes her head.  "I warned you about this.  You do not have a choice in this, and resisting?  That's another fine, another lash.  Present your ass, and give me a fresh count."

You gasp, but do.

[["I'm... I'm sorry! "(print: $Strike)!"->Strike Counter]]


:: Strike End
Even with your count completed, your body tenses at the sound of the slave behind you stepping forward.  Instead of yet another sharp snap against your rear, however, its her hand that runs gently down your tortured rear.  Laminate to laminate, her touch glides along, a ship sailing along smooth waters.

"Yes," she finally murmurs.  "We're done."

Reaching up, she unhooks your armbinder ring from the ceiling chain, allowing you to straighten back up.  Even the barest movement brings echoes of the punishment back towards your nerve endings.  Its even worse as you follow her back over to the front desk, which she takes a seat at.  

Perhaps you've learned a lesson?

"The video we have recorded of your corrective action will be most valuable to the hotel, and we hope you remember this as a lesson going forward.  Now, we were going to discuss your departure?"  The girl looks up to you, riding crop resting at the side.

[["Y-Yes."->Transport II]]


:: Transport III [Debt]
(set: $debt to 0)
The servant nods, her laminate clothing gleaming as her shackled hands collect together on her desk.  "Well, in that case, you're going to need to make your way into downtown Grand Aekora.  We're on the outskirts now, but once you get downtown you can get *anywhere*.  It's quite a walk, especially hobbled, (if: $Level is > 1)[with an armbinder,](if: $Blue is true)[in those black heels] (if: $Smoke is true)[in those black heels] (if: $Brand is true)[in those ballet heels] (if: $Sec is true)[in those cute pumps you have] (if: $Slave is true)[in standard slave regalia]."

She had been working on your checkout reciept, which she asks if you need printed.  You decline as she continues.  "Luckly, we're just down the street from the local transit hub!  The Lead system is free in a few hours, but I'm sure you would like to avoid that."

She doesn't provide a reason why you would, but instead circles the front desk to walk you to the front door.

"There are also carriages, and the train line of course.  Those take credits..." she looks to your restraints, and winks.  "But let's not get into that again.  You're a resourceful girl, I'm certain you can figure it out!"

The door to the world beyond looms, a solid block of light, a portal you  must now pass.  Your attendant peforms an elaborate curtsy as you pass.  "Thank you for staying at Diarch's Choice hotel!  I hope you enjoyed... I certainly did."

[[Step out onto the Torean streets.->PART TWO]]


:: PART TWO
Stepping out, you (if: $Level is 1)[lift a hand to shield your eyes](if: $Level is >= 2)[wish your arms weren't bound so that you could shield your eyes] from the harsh glare of system's star that looms above.  You recall that Torei is a lonely world, without neighboring planets, far from the standard trade lanes.  Perhaps that's why you expected something more alien then what actually confronts you.
(set: $showcredits to true)
The street is plain concrete, the foliage growing in the spaces of green perhaps a bit stunted, but look regular enough.  Even the buildings are not too bizarre.  You appear to be in a relatively built up city, but looking North reveals much larger towers reaching towards the sky.  That had to be downtown Grand Aekora-- and thus the direction you would need to travel, in pursuit of the promised transport center.  

But there is the matter of the *people* who share the street with you.  The wide road is bizarrely empty, but the sidewalks abound with life.  Nearly all are women, a factoid breaking through your amnesia to remind you that among the Torean-born, women greatly outnumbered men.  And some of them are looking your way.

You do not have the choice to hide, indeed your laminate only seems to announce you *wanted* the attention.  Everything is on display.  (if: $Blue is true)[Every curve of your blue-clad body shines as you begin to walk, breasts thrust out and cupped provocatively by the smooth material(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[--through which your pierced nipples are evident].  It flares with your hips, running down the smooth expanse from your naval to the zipper between your legs.  Your black boots snap out a steady rhythm as well, joined by the metal bits on you different cuffs and collar.] (if: $Smoke is true)[Every curve of your smoke-clad body shines as you begin to walk, breasts thrust out, cupped and supported by the harness below as if to highlight the provocativelyby smooth see-through material(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[--through which your pierced nipples are evident].  It flares with your hips, exposing the skin beneath as it runs down the smooth expanse from your naval to the black strip of a zipper between your legs.  Your similarly colored boots snap out a steady rhythm as well.] (if: $Brand is true)[Every curve of your catsuit-clad body shines as you begin to walk, breasts thrust out and cupped provocatively by the smooth material(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[--through which your pierced nipples are evident].  Your corset further emphasizes your femininity, enforcing the hourglass like curve as your suit flares with your hips, your entire body a gleaming advertisement for the enjoyment of others.  Walking remains an effort in your boots, but you're learning to live on your toes.] (if: $Sec is true)[Every curve of your uniformed body shines as you begin to walk, breasts thrust out and cupped provocatively by the smooth white material(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[--through which your pierced nipples are evident].  It flares with your hips, your tight skirt flexing back and forth with each step, its hug on your thighs pronounced.  Behind, your tiny peplum skirt lifts as a gust of wind blows by.] (if: $Slave is true)[Every curve of your black-clad body shines as you begin to walk, breasts thrust out and cupped provocatively by the smooth material(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[--through which your pierced nipples are evident].  Your corset further emphasizes your femininity, enforcing the hourglass like curve as your suit flares with your hips, running down the smooth expanse from your naval to the zipper between your legs.  There the hidden inserts move with every step, teasing as much as frustrating, and proving a silent companion to the more eviden snap of your boots upon the pavement.]

At least you're not alone in the experience.  Laminate clothing appears universal, everyone you pass exclusively wearing the material-- although what you infer from each outfit varies greatly.  The presence of a collar provides a rough dividing line between those who keep their eyes down, and those who stride forward confidently.  Catsuits and stilleto heels are in abundance, and even a few like yourself are visibly bound.

(if: $Blue is true)[Still, the metallic coloration of your suit does serve to set you apart from most.  The way the light catches it induces a sparkling effect, one offset by the harsh black of your other bindings.  You get the sense from those who look to you that, at the very least, you're fitting in.] (if: $Smoke is true)[Still, the semi-transparency of your suit does serve to draw attention.  Eyes linger on your chest, and you see at least one woman turn to watch you after having passed.  You get the sense from such onlookers that you're not only fitting in, but standing out a bit.] (if: $Brand is true)[Still, the words and logos placed upon your suit does serve to draw attention.  You're a walking billboard after all, glossy and obvious in your ballet heels. One pair of women who pass you by can be heard whispering about you having sold your dignity for so little though, to which you can only bite your bottom lip, momentarily obscuring the tiny logo so carefully imprinted there.] (if: $Sec is true)[Variations on your own outfit seem common, and you have to imagine similar attire is a common experience for any woman on Torei who worked in an office or something customer-facing.  Sensible but glossy, your body on display yet maintaining a professional sense.] (if: $Slave is true)[Other outfits may have drawn attention, but your heavy slave-rated uniform is all but ignored.  Passing women even seem to look away, with one growing visibly angry when you try to meet her gaze from behind your glass faceplate.  Like many of those collared, you soon are keeping your eyes on the ground.](if: $Level is >=2)[Wearing your armbinder does again remind you of just how defenseless you are, though.  Perfectly helpless.]

[[The Transport Hub looms ahead, atop a massive raised platform overlooking the city.->Transport Hub Intro]]


:: Transport Hub Intro [Tags]
A train sits idly on a large platform, raised above the street that ends before it, branching away in either direction.  Reaching it requires walking up a ramp, one you notice is far less steep then those generally seen in the galaxy beyond Torei-- were they assuming customers would be in heels?

Either way, cresting the top reveals a crowd of some size divided into three seperate lines.  Each are helpfully labeled and even color-coordinated by lines painted onto the platform, noting where one could wait for a service, or where boarding was occurring.

Less then a dozen, two of them men in tight laminate, are seated on benches outside a station marked *Carriages*.  A larger group stand in line or are seated near the area marked for *Train Boarding*.  The final, and by far the largest contingent, all stand in line for something labeled only as *The Lead.*
(if: $GoldCheat is true)[(colour: yellow)[CREDIT CHEAT ACTIVATED](set: $debt to it + 10000)]

[[Let's start with the Carriage.->Carriage Hub]]
[[Trains must be faster, let's start there.->Train Hub]]
[[The Lead?  It seems the most popular, let's start there.->Lead Hub]]


:: Carriage Hub
There isn't a line for the carriage booth at all, the mere handful of waiting passengers waiting nearby.  One of the men who you glimpsed earlier has a girl in a secretarial looking outfit (if: $Sec is true)[much like your own] on his knee, having leaned in to whisper in her ear.  Her lips are painted a bright red currently formed into an inviting 'O', as she clearly tries not to moan.  It appears his hand is up her skirt.

(if: $Sec is true or $Blue is true or $Smoke is true)[Approaching the carriage booth itself, you find a woman in a tight, bright blue servant's uniform.  It bears the livery of *Grand Aekoran Transport*.  She smiles when you ask how much it would cost for a ticket. 600 credits is the response, a tidy sum given you have exactly zero at the moment.]
(if: $Brand is true)[Approaching the carriage booth itself, you find a woman in a tight, bright blue servant's uniform.  It bears the livery of *Grand Aekoran Transport*.  Her smile fades a bit at your approach, her eyes running across your branded outfit.  When asked how much a ticket costs, she informs you it would be 600 credits-- and then goes further, suggesting a cheaper option if you cannot manage your own finances.]
(if: $Slave is true)[Approaching the carriage booth itself, you find a woman in a tight, bright blue servant's uniform.  It bears the livery of *Grand Aekoran Transport*.  Her smile ends as soon as she notices your approach.  "We do not take slaves," she declares promptly.  Showing her your Freewomb marked ID achieves little.  "Our exclusive services are not offered to anyone in full slave-rated uniform.  Please step back, or I *will* call a Truancy Officer."]
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
[[You step away, to consider your other options->Transport Hub Intro II]]


:: Train Hub [Debt]
The lines for the train aren't very long, but you don't even need to join them for information-- several large kiosks are setup near the entrance, their bright digital displays beckoning anyone to approach and learn more.  You take one of the machines up on its offer.
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
(if: $Blue is true or $Smoke is true or $Sec is true or $Brand is true)[Greeting you in the name of *Trans Torean Rail*, an animated version of a young red-haired woman guides you through the various services.  Apparently the rails are a common means of transport so near the Way Up, and Trans Torean services nearly a dozen different neighboring Ringdoms.  Tickets to Grand Aekora, your destination, cost 400 credits.

A secondary notice is given, however, that Freewombs such as yourself must be accompanied by an escort that's either male, or holds a valid Freewomb Rail Pass.  You get the sense such passes are rare as the animated woman bids you a good day, but not before pointing to her collar to remind you that any further questions can be directed to a Trans Torean slave.] 
(if: $Slave is true)[The bright, cheery greeting display from *Trans Torean Rail* ends abruptly once you step up.  In its stead, a very basic warning screen flashes before you:

*Standardized Slave-Rated Uniform detected.  Ticket sales and further assistance are not available.  Rail travel is strictly prohibited for all slaves.  Use of this kiosk is strictly prohibited for all slaves.  Your account has charged a fee of 10 credits as punishment, per Aekoran Slave Codes (section 395, paragraph 8). Step away now, or further corrective measures will be authorized.* (set: $debt to it - 10)]

[[Well, shit.  Step back and consider your other options.->Transport Hub Intro II]]


:: Lead Hub
Just what *the Lead* entails isn't exactly clear to you, but the line for it is by far the largest.  All are women, and you notice a secondary line featuring a few dressed in the full slave-rated gear you (if: $Blue is true or $Smoke is true or $Sec is true or $Brand is true)[saw mentioned in the Wardrobe Device.  Uniformally black, with strict breath regulating masks, tight corsets, and tall boots, you have to imagine its not a particularly comfortable outfit to wear.](if: $Slave is true)[are also being subjected to.  Watching the nearest closely, you can see her hips shifting back and forth.  Its not hard to imagine the dildos undoubtedly locked inside her, a line of thought that causes your own cunt to ache.  Taking as deep a breath as your corset and mask will allow, you at least realize there must be a seperate service for those in slave regalia.]
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
Above the crowd a large sign provides what you're looking for: rules and cost.  Slaves are allowed to travel for free(if: $Slave is true)[ (you would not qualify, given an owner is mentioned as necessary)].  Freewombs such as yourself are also allowed to travel for free, but only at designated times-- apparently early in the morning, or for a few hours before nightfall.  You suppose you could always wait awhile for that free period, but that could put you dangerously off schedule.  Actually purchasing a ticket is also possible, at the cost of 200 credits.

[[At least its relatively cheap?  Take a step back to consider.->Transport Hub Intro II]]


:: Transport Hub Intro II
Without a credit to your name, and nothing of value in your possession, getting into Downtown will be difficult.  Yet checking all your options seems a good idea, if only to set yourself a goal.  There has to be a way to make some quick money on Torei.

[[How about the Carriages?->Carriage Hub]]
[[The Train is always an option.->Train Hub]]
[[What of The Lead?->Lead Hub]]
(if: $TransportCheck is >= 3)[Turning around, you make your way to a nearby railing, the raised platform allowing you a good view of the nearby streets.  You need to scrounge a few credits, and through the milling crowds you do indeed spot [[a few potential opportunities.->Street Hub]]]

You're just one laminate-clad woman among many now.  The occasional passing man causes more of a stir, those of your gender always making sure to clear out of their way.  Your focus is on find credits, however, as you recall the possibilities you glimpsed as you descend beneath the transport hub's raised platform.

One of the massive supporting pillars bears a number of posters, some advocating nearby sales, others city announcements.

:: Offworlder Greet
You continue your approach towards the man, seemingly alone in his masculinity and offworld textiles-- adrift in a sea of laminate clad women.  As you get closer you can see that most are pointedly avoiding him, his attempts to address anyone passing by being most often flately rejected.  

"The Society does *good work*, you can donate, or we can help," you overhear, breaking through the crowd just as a woman in pristine white laminate makes a display of crumpling one of his brochures and tossing it over her shoulder.
(set: $OffworlderCheck to true)
To his credit, the man takes it in stride.  He's tall, well built, trending towards the rugged look you remember popular in the more swashbuckling vid series.  With the arms of his shirt rolled up you can see he's well muscled, giving a sense of physicality that is not matched by the disinterest of nearly everyone around him.

[["Excuse me," you address him.  "Sir?"->Offworlder Greet 2]]

:: Nun Greet
<img src="img/u7Wnr7F.png">

The eerie 'forest' is set apart from the road by a simple wrought-iron fence, rising cage-like far above your head.  A gate stands open, however, the gentle sigh of the wind running through the strange plants, seemingly inviting you in.  It's quiet.  *Too quiet.*

<img src="img/9MFJwF5.png" width="30%" height="30%">

Several benches line the wall that doubled as the raised platfrom for the transport hub above, and most of them are full-- except for one, at which the woman you saw in the hotel is seated alone.  Her glossy laminated legs are crossed, one over the other so that a sharp stiletto flashes in the light at your approach.  The inset of her black boots are chromed steel.

She takes a long pull from some manner of electronic cigarette, the tip bright red.  Exhaling crimson smoke, you catch a cinnamon scent.  Her eyes are hidden by mirrored glasses and she doesn't turn to regard you, but you're given a command nevertheless.

"On your knees, slave."
(set: $IsabellaCheck to true)
[[You remain standing.  "I am not a slave."->IsGreetRefuse]]
[[Your instincts compel.  You kneel before her.->IsGreetAck]]

She takes another long drag of her cigarette, twin embers reflected in her glasses.  Several moments pass in silence as she holds it in, savoring the flavor.  Release follows, red smoke rising from equally red lips as she finally turns to regard you directly.

"(if: $Slave is true or $Blue is true)[Yet you have that collar.  Show me your ID."  She takes the card you provide, sliding down her glasses to inspect the FREEWOMB stamped across the top.  A smile forms. "Consider me surprised.  Just enjoying being restrained like that, hm?"](else:)[It never hurts to check.

Her tone is sharp, but not harsh.  Commanding, but not shrill.  You find yourself unable to resist.  On the sidewalk of a public street, as strangers pass by, you kneel to the woman before you.

"Knees spread(if: $Level is 1)[, hands behind your back], she continues.  You comply.  

"Eyes down." Several nearby women are clearly looking your way, you realize as you look down at the pavement.

"Good girl.  Now show me your ID."  She takes your small card once offered.  The image it bore of a bright, smiling traveler in a fashionable cotton dress is quite the juxtaposition to the laminated woman kneeling at her feet.  The card is returned to you.

"Freewomb?  Interesting.  Liberty can be such a burden, can it not?"  She steps back and returns to her seat, indicating that you are allowed to rise.

You sense Isabella would respond best to the truth, and offer it as best you can.  It is not easy, your situation being as bizarre as it is shameful.  Or perhaps memory loss and laminate locks are normal on Torei?  At the very least she doesn't seem perturbed, but listens quietly, smoking that cinnamon device.  As you finish she remains silent for a time long enough to worry you.  But she does eventually turn her head, your own glossy reflection visible in her glasses.  You get the feeling she's... *intrigued*.

"I don't do charity," she states matter-of-factly.  "But... I am open to you earning a few credits."

She crosses her legs again, wipe hips and full thighs hard to ignore.

"I could offer you a chance to earn some extra credits in the proper Torean fashion," Isabella notes with amusement.  "You still have your body, and your dignity.  I could play with those.  A little pleasure, or perhaps a little etiquette?  I won't tell you what's involved, where is the fun in that-- but I will give you up to 50 credits each, depending on how well you do."

A tiled room, a simply display before you.  You remember this, and you remember what comes next as the door behind you closes and arms seize your wrists, ankles, and throat. The Wardrobe whirls, arms cycling upward as those gripped to your wrists suddenly jerk your arms back.  It isn't a gentle experience.  Given the larger print job, three of the device's appendages begin circling your arms, coating them in the laminate that is quickly flash-set into a tight layer.  Reinforcements are built into the area around your hands to prevent an escape, and so that a large ring can be emplaced-- which, once cooled an armature seizes, demonstrating just how easily you can now be controlled that way.  The final component is the portion that circles around your shoulders and upper chest, anchoring the binder and preventing it from being slipped off easily.

You emerge to find Isabella waiting, her glasses resting on her forehead so that she can given the Wardrobe's work a discerning look over.  She tugs on the laminate covering your shoulders, and the outline of your elbows.  Whatever she finds apparently meets her standards as she reaches up, dropping her glasses back into place.

Stepping forward she reaches out, one hand finding your (if: $Brand is true or $Slave is true)[tightly corseted] waist, corralling you as her other hand explores one of your shiny(if: $Blue is true)[blue] (if: $Smoke is true)[smoky] (if: $Brand is true)[logo adorned] (if: $Sec is true)[white] (if: $Slave is true)[black] breasts.

"See how nice this is?" She asks.  "Helpless."

As if to underscore that point she releases you, but not without a rude slap of your ass.  "You earned those 25 credits," she laughs, following you back up and around the corner to her bench.

You're hobbled and bound, and the Wardrobe knows it.  The customary arms grab at your wrists, ankles, and throat-- but another also seizes the ring set in your armbinder.  You're left imagining what for, or at least until it demonstrates.

The device holding onto your armbinder's ring pulls suddenly downward just as your legs are yanked forward.  You're suspended in the air now, back arched, breasts pressing against the laminate cups of your oufit as they're thrust out.  (if: $lave is true or $Brand is true)[Your corset makes the position painful in the extreme.]

It's then that a new armature appears, this one new, at least to your eyes.  Instead of a gripping limb, or a painter-like nozzle, this has something much more sinister: a lancing needle.  Long, silvery... and move mechanically down, towards your breasts.  The protection offered by your outfit is momentarily vacated, solvants being applied that melt the material readily in a steam that fans suck away greedily.  With unnerving precision, the needle is positioned.  There is no fanfare, no warning-- it merely shifts suddenly, one moment waiting beside your nipple, the next pierced straight through it.  

The Wardrobe device doesn't much care for your reaction.  It does provide a quite fast acting healing agent, undoubtedly a Torean marvel of bioengineering that would have fascinated the Prospector that is your job title, but that seems less a kindness and more simple utilitarianism.  Once healed, a silvery barbell is inserted, your violation now marked by the small silver balls now framing the highlight of your chest.

You hang limply as the procedure is repeated on your other nipple.  Afterward the nozzles return, reapplying the laminate of your suit.  Its as if they had never torn it apart, but the foreign sensations emanating from your chest are a constant reminder...

Your plugged cunt, once again wet and aching, had only grown worse as she embraced you.  Looking out from your heavy mask, its hard not to get lost in the reflection of your equally black bodies-- thighs, rears, legs entwined to the point its hard to tell where she begins and you end.  Pressing your cunt, humping whatever was pressed between your legs, seems a good enough start as any.
(set: $PlayCheck to it - 1)
She responds with an immediate frown, those red lips looking so fierce as her brows pull down.  Almost immediately she reaches out, seizing your (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[pierced] nipple, twisting hard.  Even through your laminate it hurts, and you yelp.  She doesn't let up, following it with a firm slap on your rear.

"No," she states firm.  "This is about my pleasure, not yours.  You will have what I give you, and not a bit more."

Moving onto your knees, the concrete you find yourself upon is hard against them.  Laminate was proving to be many things, but it does not provide much in the way of padding.  

Now above you Isabella shifts her own posture, spreading her legs.  One glossy steel-heeled shoe falls to each side of you, columns of black laminate running up, becoming round thighs before they meet in the space between her legs.  A zipper (if: $Slave is true or $Blue is true or $Smoke is true or $Brand is true)[much like your own catsuit] can be seen there.

"Back straight," she commands.  "(if: $Level is 1)[Hands behind your back.]  Chest out.  Don't rest that rear, keep it up, just above your heels."

As you comply, taking up half the sidewalk, several of the people passing by are forced to skirt around you.  Isabella still doesn't care at all, and at the very least the road continues to be utterly without traffic.

"Which would you like to cover?"

:: PlayRev
"Ah yes," the woman before you nods.  "Reverence is an ancient Torean custom.  Were I in control of the Way Up, I would demand instructions on it be given to every arriving offworlder.  Any Torean worth being collared by will demand you practice it, after all.  So what exactly is a reverence?"

She pauses to draw another inhalation of her sweetly scented electronic cigarette.  "Some call it the Torean curtsy.  In short: as a woman, slave or freewomb, it is expected during any greeting or parting through which you are interacting with a superior in social rank.  How you approach it is largely dependent on your clothing, however.  And your bondage.  The *classic* reverence is done if you are wearing a skirt, whereupon you spread your legs-- watching the distance carefully, too far and it is considered wanton, whoreish-- and lift your skirt to present your womanhood to the other person.  It does not matter if you are thus bared, or wearing panties, or even chastity.  The purpose is merely to present your current situation.  During this, you lower your eyes, and depending on the social status of the person opposite you bow.  Just a hint for a peer, further for someone of authority-- further still in formal situations, or if you are in the presence of any free male."

Isbella gestures towards your oufit.  "In your case? (if: $Sec is true)[If your arms are free, you would perform the classic reverence.  That particular outfit is, in fact, designed with just such a use in mind.  You would pull the hem of your skirt up, reveal yourself, then bow as far as circumstances demand.](else:)[Wearing a catsuit, as we both are, is a common enough thing as well.  In our cases, if your arms are free, we would bow as usual, but in a singular smooth motion as we undo our crotch zipper-- then zip it closed again.  The trick is to do it all quickly enough to appear well practiced, but not so quickly as to appear hurried.  And if bound(if: $Level is > 1)[ as you are]?  Then, in casual encounters you would spread your legs and press your hips forward, present your zipper as best you can.  In formal circumstances you would kneel, legs spread.]"

[["Reverence... got it."->IsPlayE Hub]]


:: PlayCurfew
Like a reigning schoolmistress, Isabella tips her head in a sage-like fashion.  "Of course.  Each Ringdom is different, and a handful do not hold such rules... but most do, including this one.  Curfew applies to all women of majority, and effectively demands we not travel outdoors after dark unescorted."

She sighs.  "It is one of the more troublesome laws, truth be told.  A legal escort must be male, and even with you offworlders coming in there are still precious few men.  You must be leashed as well, and obviously there is a very real power dynamic involved there.  Alternatives are a freewomb curfew exemption, a thing *very* rarely given, using point-to-point transport such as a carriage... or the Lead.  Generally I utilize a carriage, but if say I were to attend a fancy gala a male escort would be expected.  High society thrives on discussions of which man you have acquired for such things... or been forced to submit to."

[["I believe I understand."->IsPlayE Hub]]


:: PlayMen
"You want to discuss *men*," Isabella replies, taking an amused tone.  "All women do, eventually."

She settles into her lesson with a slight shift of her seated position to become more comfortable.  "You may or may not remember, given your situation, that men on Torei are rare-- generally one existing for every ten women.  This gives them power, and the laws of most Ringdoms only further that.  As long as they are not slaves, and few are, they are not subjected to curfew.  They are excluded from most Ministry of Truancy spot checks and detainment.  And earning credits is hardly difficult for them, a night providing legal escort is often enough for someone to live comfortably for a week."

Her legs shift, uncrossing, then crossing again.  "When interacting with a man, understand that you are subservient to him even if you have no formal contract or relation.  If he wishes to touch you, it would generally be unwise to resist.  If he seeks your favor, consider his intentions carefully.  He has limits, but they are... far more nebulous then those you have, as a woman.  Ah, always perform reverence to men, Toreans will expect that."

She smiles.  "I have read of how things are where you come from.  Remember that it is *very* different here.  There is no equality, and it is the rare woman indeed who is superior to any male."

[[Torei's culture is strange, but... "I understand."->IsPlayE Hub]]


:: PlayOutfit
"What Torei is *known* for," Isabella declares.  "But a practice few offworlders ever try to truly understand.  They come to Torei with their preconceptions, their love of a liberty they hold to dearly."

Her white teeth gleam from behind red.  "The stories of wayward tourists falling into slavery are common enough, and popular... but what surprises most is how many slaves entered their collars *willingly*.  It is not an easy life, mind you, but there are protections that come with service.  Privileges, too.  Be that financially, spiritually, or with regards to relationships... the possibilities are endless."

(if: $Slave is true)[Your instructor for the hour eyes your outfit.  "And you're already closer then most freewombs to that life."]

"Regardless," she concludes.  "The moral of this story is that you cannot understand slavery on Torei, not yet.  You need to live among-- or within-- it for sometime.  Nothing beats practical experience."

[["I understand.->IsPlayE Hub]]


:: PlayETest
"Are you?"  She asks, tapping the top of the bench with a gloved finger.  "I suppose we shall see about that.  I will ask you five simple questions, and you will respond to them.  This will not simply be rout memorization, mind you, I will require you extrapolate what we discussed.  Each one you get right, I'll give you ten credits.  If not... well, I still hope you will have learned *something.*"  

She reaches into her purse again, pulling forth a small remote.  That she had added to your outfit suddenly seems a lot more suspicious.

"Is that understood?"
(set: $PlayCheck to 0)
[["Yes, I understand."->IsQ1]]
[["...yes."->IsQ1]]


:: PlayImprov
Isabella turns to the topic readily.  "The Ministry of Improvements, yes... this one is less strictly about etiquette, but important for someone in your position to know, nevertheless.  Like most other Ministries on Torei, the Ministry of Improvements operates in many Ringdoms and provides a particular service: alteration of the human body.

"I do not intend to provide you with a history lesson, but suffice it to say that Torei has far more advanced medical technology then the galaxy abroad, due to the presence of the AIs.  Thus the improvement of our bodies is largely seen as a trivial matter.  Simple aesthetic changes are common, adjusting your breasts or hips for instance, or the color of your eyes.  Few Toreans retain their strictly natural attributes for long after their majority," she notes.  "Especially slaves.  Improving *them* is almost a requirement, if one wishes to impress among high society.  A woman should fill out her catsuit in all the right ways, after all."

(if: $Brand is true)[The seated woman looks to you.  "Your heels, for example?  The Ministry of Improvements could adjust your feet, your tendons.  Allow you to wear ballets for weeks at a time.  Or... the Ministry could make changes that *require* you wear them to walk properly."]

She shrugs.  "The Ministry of Improvements can get quite... intensive, as well.  Gender modifications, non-human additions such as tails, antlers, what have you... your imagination is often the limit.  Or that of a slave's owner, at least."

[["Ministry of Improvements... got it."->IsPlayE Hub]]
[["Would... an offworlder be able to trade for those medical advances, perhaps...?"->IsPlayE QQ]]


:: IsPlayE QQ
Isabella meets your eyes, lips pursed.  "No, not usually.  The Ministry of Improvements guards its techniques and technologies jealously... and for obvious reasons, one does not wish to run afoul of it.  Even those with wealth, such as myself, interact with them carefully."

She shrugs.  "The occasional fool gets something from the polar AIs, through their Daemons.  They are the originator of the technology, after all.  But it rarely ends well for them."

[["...right.  Got it."->IsPlayE Hub]]


:: IsQ1
"First question: you have been on the planet for sometime, and another offworlder coworker you've known for years arrives on-planet to assist with whatever work brought you here in the first place.  He is *male*.  You meet for the first time on a public Torean street, and you are wearing..."

<img src="img/9UEUNGC.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

She points to a woman passing by in a sleek red and black dress, corseted with a short skirt.

"...that.  How do you greet him?"

[["I greet him as I always have, we know each other."->IsQ1Fail]]
[["I greet him as an offworlder, he does not know the customs.."->IsQ1Fail]]
[["I greet him with a slight reverence, I have more experience then he does on the planet."->IsQ1Fail]]
[["I greet him with a full reverence, skirt up, eyes down."->IsQ1Pass]]


:: IsQ1Fail
"Incorrect," Isabella replies.  "You are both offwolders, and he may not even know Torean customs.  But that does not matter, not when you're in a public place as I described.  He is a free male, and you are a woman.  You must give him full reverence.  Skirt up, eyes down, bow.  If not for his sake, then for your own.  You never know who is watching, and business deals have fallen through for far lesser breaches of etiquette then it getting around that you do not respect men in such a manner."

A bit of a flourish is made as she holds out the small remote.  Before you can inquire as to its purpose, she presses the singular button-- and a sharp shock runs through your collar(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[ and your pierced nipples.]  You nearly jump out of your heels in surprise, shaking your neck (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[and breasts] to escape the lingering ache emanating from the experience.

"Try harder." Isabella demands.

She continues on immediately.  "Question two: you are by yourself at a store, and lose track of time.  It is night, the nearest lead is 20 minutes away.  The store owner is male.  How would you best get home?"

[["There... must be curfew shelters of some sort, right?  I could wait all night."->IsQ2Pass]]

"Correct."  Isabella lifts a hand, as if to indicate the sky above.  "You realized curfew is in effect, that's good.  I did not mention it, but curfew shelters exist in areas far away from easy transport for just that sort of situation.  To summon a carriage you would need to be on the street for at least some time, that would be a Curfew violation.  Walking to the Lead would require the same.  And asking for a male stranger's help in such a matter?  I asked for the *best* option.  He would have complete power over you, even if he agreed his terms would be undoubtedly strict."

Another question follows.  "Considering what we discussed regarding slavery, how common do you think self-admission to the Ministry of Improvements is on Torei?"

She presses the button on her remote, your collar (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[nipples] suddenly being subjected to a brief electric shock.  Another lesson, and one Isabella doesn't comment on.

Another question follows.  "Considering what we discussed regarding slavery, how common do you think self-admission to the Ministry of Improvements is on Torei?"

"Incorrect."  She depresses the button on her remote, sending a sharp shock through your collar (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[and the device attached to your tits.] You stomp your feet in response, biting down a yell, unable to escape the sensation.  Isabella only shakes her head.  "You must do better then that.  Now, as to the answer, the Ministry of Improvements is *not* free, but here on Torei the technology is good enough that many procedures are very inexpensive.  It is very common for prospective slaves to improve themselves in pursuit of some particular collar, or for freewombs to seek a raise by first visting the Ministry.  Even offworlders travel here for completely mundane surgeries that would be nearly impossible, or very expensive, elsewhere."


Yet another question follows.  "You mentioned being a... businesswoman, of sorts?  Let us try another business question.  You are meeting with a Torean woman to sign some sort of mutually beneficial deal.  You're wearing that same outfit as before, the red one, and are meeting in your hotel room.

Isabella shakes her head.  "Wrong.  You are women, and you are signing a mutually beneficial agreement.  Thus a full reverence would be unnecessarily ceding the other woman power.  Even though the setting is private, however, it is still a professional engagement.  The proper greeting is thus a partial reverence.  Skirt up, eyes down, very slight bow.  If you're both particularly practiced, this should be performed at the same time."

The remote in her hand is pressed, your collar (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[and breasts] coming alive with sudden electricty.  She holds the button down, subjecting you to the punishment for a solid second.  "Come on now."

Then she licks her lips.  "Last question: have I been a patient at the Ministry of Improvements?"

Her smile tells you what your gut had already warned: this was a much more tricky question.  She is certainly beautiful, that is clear: full chest, wide hips, inviting lips.  You've seen her eyes are grey, and her hair is black.  Those were hardly exotic options..."

"*Good answer,*" she replies, having been clearly poised to use the remote in her hand savagely.  "It doesn't matter what I look like, or that I am Torean born.  It does not matter that the Ministry of Improvements is so readily used.  Here, in Aekora, you do not ask a lady of any importance such a question.

Pushing its lone button, the remote commands a harsh burst of electrict from your collar(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[ and pierced nipples], your yelp devolving into a low moan as she keeps the current coming for at least five seconds.  By the time she lets off, the muscles in your neck are dreadfully sore(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[ and your heavy chest aches, the piercings you had been subjected to used so readily.

She tips her head to the side, retaking her seat along the way.  "I hope this proved to be... a learning experience?  Even without your memory situation, the way we educate offworlders is shameful.  Each and every one of you should be taught how to perform a reverence, at the very least..."

Looking down, she flicks perhaps the barest hint of dust from her laminate outfit.  Or perhaps it is to hide the slight smile that forms?

"My Freewomb train pass is in my name only.  I cannot simply give it to you, nor would I particularly want to.  As I said, I do not *do* charity.  But..."

She looks back up to you, now *clearly* smiling.  "My train pass does allow for my taking along personal belongings.  Two pieces of luggage," she pats the purse at her side, "...and a slave."

Isabella watches your reaction intently.  "I am traveling to downtown Grand Aekora anyway, and would allow you to complete whatever business you have in the city.  But you would be doing so under a proper slave collar and term of service.  After you complete whatever you intend to do in the city, you will serve out your service contract with me.  Standard issue, in all respects.  I've come to learn offworlders are best enslaved under such contracts, less paperwork.  The shortest standard slave contract is for six weeks-- with extensions, of course, if necessary or desired."

Led through the neighborhood one last time, this trip is altogether different-- you do so on a leash, your newly minted Mistress leading you.  She sets a harsh pace as well, despite the strictures of your slave suit, her steel-clad heels snapping sharply with every step.  

Reaching the Transport Platform she leads you up, then takes the lead dealing with the Transit attendant and Truant Officer manning the last checkpoint before the trains themselves.  Where once you may have had to offer payment or negotiate with the Officer, now Isabella handles it all, even presenting your SLAVE-marked ID when prompted.  

"Remember to keep it on that leash," the Officer reminds your owner as together you're waved through.

Again Isabella leads the way as you approach the sleek trains, boarding a car she chooses.  The seats within are situated with tables between every two, forming small, intimate booths.  Sliding into one, she forces you down with a sharp tug on your leash.

"Slaves kneel, they rarely sit," she explains, crossing her legs beneath the table.  It lends to the pensive posture she takes, leaning forward to examine you more closely.

"Eyes down," she commands first, before continuing.  "We need to discuss our business downtown."

The words pass your lips, but there time seems to slow.  Your memory may be shot full of holes, but the further back you go the clearer it is.  Thousands of worlds are out there, billions of human beings.  Going about their lives, perhaps traveling, certainly choosing to do as they willed.

And you're about to reject that.  Isabella had promised to let you finish your last deal, if you desired, but there would be no trimphant escape from Torei via the Way Up afterward.  A contract would make your mere presence in the massive terminal at its base illegal-- slaves were strictly prohibited, you remember seeing a sign that declared that.  Some in the position you're so close to had to have tried to run, then, for such a sign to even be necessary.  It's not hard to imagine why they would try.

A Torean slave did not have many rights.  Isabella would keep you bound, in laminate.  She would alter your body to suit her whims.  And what if you resisted?  You would be punished until you complied.

"Here on Torei, certain things are still on laminate paper," she announces, breaking your revelry.  In her hands she holds a glossy piece of thin-stamped laminate, as black as her outfit and your suit, line after line of white writing apparent upon it.

"If you have any other questions before we do this, now would be the time.  Or if you would like to do anything else by yourself, you should do that first.  There is not going back."

[["I do have questions."->SlaveHub]]
[["I can't do this right now, let me think about this...->Isabella Hub]]


:: GetSlave2
Her attention snaps to you immediately.  "That's what I like to hear.  Follow me."

Rising in a flourish of black laminate, Isabella leads you around the corner of the raised transit platform, talking as she walks.  "As we discussed, you're committing to nothing more then the suit at this time.  You can always back out on our proposed contract until it is signed, remember that."

A large opening leads down into an area excavated beneath, a sign over which reads *Pubic Facilities*.  Those facilities turn out to be several bathrooms, one marked for Men, one for Freewombs, and one for Slaves-- alongside a row of Wardrobe Devices.  Changing outfits after or just prior to a trip seems to be common.

Isabella selects an open Wardrobe for you, using her own credentials to bring up a far more extensive catalog of options then you had seen at the Hotel.  She pays a substantial fine for the early removal of your current outfit, the brief look at her account showing a *very* large balance.  Meanwhile, a warning flashes in response to her selection of the standardized slave suit:

*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

She dismisses it with a smile.  "Ready?"

[[Step in.->GetSlave3]]


:: GetSlave3
You know the drill by this point, the arms the emerge once the door closes behind you almost like old friends.  They grip your wrists, your ankles, and your throat as the machine truly revs up.  The first step is a simple one, demonstrating the utility of the drain beneath you: a solvant dissolves your suit, your bindings, everything-- in a matter of seconds.  Only metals or other installed compponents remain, but those are plucked by a pair of waiting arms as they fall to the floor.  Recycling!

The urge is there to close your eyes, as if ignorance could prevent what was about to occur.  Is this *really* what you wanted?  But your confidence holds, allowing you the only seat in the house as the show begins. Further mechanical arms and implements emerge, the largest being a ring wide enough that it barely fit the small room.  It hovers above you, a far too large halo, waiting only for an attendant arm to strategically place your blonde hair before the device descends.

Nozzles built into the ring emit a pungent substance as soon as it descends past the crown of your head.  For a moment you think it paint, and it does adhere like the stuff, but the sensation is fleeting-- as following the emitters a white-light laser passes over the freshly applied material, and it flash-cools.  What had been a thick spray is now a thin, slick, glossy material.  Holes at your mouth, nose, and eyes are quickly excised.  Cold upon your skin, but already your body is warming it up.  Torei's all but sacred material, its most readily available substance: **laminate.**

Thus your suit is quiet literally printed on, the base layer a solid midnight black.  The ring descends bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the zipper between your legs, the tiny metal components pre-formed and merely placed by the rapid-fire staccato movements of a particuarly agile mechanized arm.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on the most intensive component of your outfit: the corset.  Several times the arms work along your midsection, printing in thick black material, before pre-forged strips of steel emerge.  Those would be the bones that ensured a corset could trim the waist effectively, and once submerged into the thick material a final flash of light sets the material.  Its not until synthetic lacing is carefully worked in a pattern through the holes along your back that the device actually begins to function, however.  With every tug it grows tighter, never painful, but definitely uncomfortable.  By the time the Wardrobe concludes, your chest is thrust out in response, while your back is straight and breathing takes some effort.

[[And it only continues...->Get Slave 4B]]


:: Get Slave 4
No.  One last accessory remains, having been listed on the original selection as... **inserts**.

Adrenaline shoots through your system as the Wardrobe realigns itself again, this time positioning two large arms, one before your lower torso, the other just behind it.  Long, thick cylinder-like forms begin to extrude from the arms, taking the shape of what you recognize quite immediately as masculine physiology.  As they work, another more nimble arm presses forward, seizing upon the only zipper on your suit.  A mathematically simple arc carries it down between your legs, exposing a set of holes matched so perfectly to the now fully formed dildos.  Your body tenses as a syrup-like lubricant is applied to each.

[[Focus on your breathing.->GetSlave 5]]


:: GetSlave 5
No further warning is given.  With sudden explosive action, the inserts drive forward.  They find the waiting holes readily enough, then twist, as if screwing their way into your body.  Despite yourself a moan escapes your ruby red (and masked) lips as you're pierced from both ends.  They plunge further, and further-- your mind screams for an end, your body assures you it cannot take anymore.  Yet it does.  Still further, further, further...

Until you're hilted on the ends, hips swaying minutely as you try fruitlessly to adapt to the sensation.  It may be amusing in restrospect, if you ever allow yourself to remember this moment, how gentle the final arm is that pulls your zipper closed again.  A small padlock on the end is almost an afterthought.

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

You collapse to your knees, the short distance an altogether new experience as your inserts shift deep within your cunt and rear.  Again you moan, this time frustrated with yourself as you try to focus, breathing hard against the stricture of your mask.  It takes several minutes, but eventually you find yourself watching the tight, glossy material covering your chest gently rise and fall.  Your posture is ensured by the corset, while also making each breath a bit of an effort, at least until your body adapted.  The sensation of the laminate is almost otherwordly as well, light pressure upon your body from toe to head, a lover's embrace you cannot escape.  Excepting the zipper between your legs (and that is locked), there is no point of entrance, no direct break in the experience.  Only smooth laminate, and the labored sound of your own breathing.

Running a hand down the slick material reveals laminate to laminate contact to be almost frictionless.  It's almost too easy to forget your own hand as it glides along your thigh-- as a strong compulsion draws the limb inward, towards the nexus of your legs.  You resist... for the moment.  Instead you struggle back to your feet, biting your lip, pelvis thrusting slightly in reaction to the sensations within.  Your heels do not help matters, the effect of being forced onto your toes one that will certainly take some effort to combat.

(if: $Level is > 0)[It's then that the armatures return, one last brief experience as you're pulled back up into position.  Did you think you were going to get our of your punishments from the hotel so easily?  They're rebuilt in short order, your hobble chain(if: $Level is > 1)[ and armbinder] replaced by shiny black new ones.  Only then are you release for the last time.]

The Wardrobe's display flicks back into existence, a final sentence emerging upon it.

*Your dressing order has now been completed.  If this machine is functioning under slave protocols, you may be held until a legally recognized owner or agent arrives to collect you.  Otherwise, the door will open shortly.  Watch your step, and enjoy...*

The doors open as promised, allowing you to shuffle awkwardly back out into the dim light of the far corridor.  Isabella awaits expectantly.

[[Make your way there.->Get Slave 6]]


:: Get Slave 6
She does not spare your body her hands, the black laminate of her gloves gliding so effortlessly over your own obsidian form as she examines every detail.  Your breath catches in your throat, nearly choking you considering how little oxygen the mask seemed to allow, when her fingers glide momentarily between your legs.

"I can barely tell its *you* in there," she declares, seemingly quite satisfied.  "You're really going to struggle with that, I can tell already.  Good."

She steps back, if only to take you all in at once.  Your new corset forces your chest out while emphasizing the curve from hip to waist, forming a silhouette as provacative as it is lewd.  (if: $Level is 2)[The armbinder only furthers the effect(if: $Level is 3 or 4)[ while your pierced nipples are hidden only until light rolls across your chest, the steel nubs pressing against your laminate].]

Isabella's hands collect together, she seems almost proud.  "Well, there we are.  As I promised, those locks you're wearing are time-sensative right now.  You can walk back up that ramp and never see me again, if you like."

Her red lips form into a smile.  "But if you still want the contract... I want you to explore, talk to others nearby.  Get different views of what Torei can be. And if you *still* want it... come back to me.  We will take a walk to the nearest Ministry of Wombs office, then."

You focus on your breathing as she leads you back to her bench, where she takes a seat, lighting up her electronic cigarette again.

[["I can't do this right now, let me think about this..."->Isabella Hub]]
[["I don't have any further questions  Let's finalize this."]]


:: "Are there any further terms I should know about?"
"Well--" she replies, removing her glasses to look into your mask, meeting your gaze directly.  "This is a standard slave contract, by Aekoran law.  The same thing women in your position have been signing for... hundreds of years, although quite short by most measurements.  Six weeks of guaranteed enslavement on your part.  More, if you trigger punishment clauses.  All the standard revoking of your personal liberties, as we discussed.  Including your full body rights.  My family's appendixes are applied as well, House Naram-Sin's lawyers always demand that.  Those are straightforward-- if anything would happen to me, your slave contract would pass to the House trust unless my will specifies otherwise. If you were to have any children during your time in the collar-- impossible given your term of service, but I should mention it-- boys would be raised by my House.  Girls would be enslaved upon reaching their majority."

[[You nod, deep in thought...->SlaveHub]]


:: "Do you have any other slaves...?"
"I do," Isabella states simply.  "By my family's standards, my estate is small, but I wouldn't be a full-blooded Naram-Sin without a few pieces of collared property.  I have a carriage and two attendant ponygirls, a governess, and a soubrette.  You would be my 5th."

[["...soubrette?"->IsSoubAsk]]
[[You're not the first, at least...->SlaveHub]]


:: "What would my role be, as a slave?"
Isabella's eyes narrow slightly.  "I'm... not sure, yet.  You would be my first offworlder, and you will need a period of training.  That's why I intend to keep you in that standard uniform you're wearing right now, for a few weeks at least.  Whatever I decide, it will be quite the change for you, I would imagine.  The Torean household has had... centuries to adapt to the precence of slaves.  There are many niche roles, and opportunities for one such as yourself.  You will be no different then any other collared slut."

[["Just another slave..."->SlaveHub]]


:: "Where would I be living?"
"My estate in Grand Aekora," Isabella replies readily.  "Technically it's an apartment, but when its two stories tall and *really* spacious... I call it an estate.  Oh, do you mean where within that?  The slave quarters, of course.  A cell at first, but I do allow some of my girls a bed."

[["A cell..."->SlaveHub]]


:: "I don't have any further questions  Let's finalize this."
"You're *sure?*"  She looks to you, lips pulled into a tight line.  "There is no going back after this.  If you want more time to think about it, I would implore you to do so."

Behind her glasses, grey eyes shine with clear excitement.  "Then we need only travel to the local Ministry of Wombs, a branch office isn't far."

From her purse she pulls forth a length of laminate cord, one end formed into a simple loop, the other a steel shackle. It's the later she hooks to the waiting ring on the front of your collar, forming a leash she uses to guide you along.  

You walk the streets of Torei as a freewomb for the last time, leashed to a woman you barely knew, on your way towards enslavement.  Even without your plugs pumping into your cunt with every step, everything that follows is something of a blur.  Perhaps you should be taking it all end, but you find yourself focusing on Isabella herself.  Her corset, the bow so primly done.  Her ass, so full and glossy, as she walks.  And the lingering scent of cinnamon, as sharp and heady as any proper intoxicant...

The Ministry of Wombs indeed have a small branch office a few blocks away.  You're left by the door alongside several other women, each of you leashed to a series of hooks provided for just that purpose.  It takes some time, but eventually you're retrieved.  Taken into a small room, you are forced to kneel, legs spread and eyes down.  A Ministry employee takes your ID card, and then asks a series of simple questions.  Afterward, with Isabella standing above you, hand on your laminate-covered head, the Ministry employee requests you repeat after her:

Given the intended production of a full scale regulation mask, the promised makeup is applied next.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened and your eyelashes extended, producing an alluring effect.  And your lips are now a bright red coloration, an interesting detail given what comes next.

That would be your mask, listed for *breath regulation*.  You already have been provided with a thin hood much akin to the rest of your catsuit, but this secondary mask is much thicker, several armatures working together to forge it upon your face.  A handful of metal components are integrated as well, but your field of vision had already been restricted enough that you barely notice.  Indeed, before you know it a curved glass panel is being placed just before your eyes, the laminate seals along the edge flash-cooling.

Your next breath, the first within your new enclosed environment, is thus harder.  *Much* harder.  You gasp, trying to suck in enough oxygen-- only for your corset's constriction to assert itself.  It's a devious combination, one you would have almost certainly cursed had not the machine (and thus your own focus) already shifted elsewhere.

Several attending arms move back up to your throat, casting thick laminate in yet another layer until several steel segments (much like those trimming your waist) are sunk into the material.  The Wardrobe was ensuring your head remained up, but you're hit with the immediate sensation that was no longer necessary-- the collar would ensure your posture going forward.

Yet another componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall stilleto heels and a thick platform for your toes being extruded into place.  Black laminate follows, coating your feet and providing the anchor on which laces are quickly assembled.

To be on your knees, in laminate from head to toe, giving away your rights word by word...

It ends with a congratulations from the employee, who returns your ID card before leaving.  *Freewomb* is still visible along the top, but over the red letters in bold black print something new has been stamped: **SLAVE.**

Reaching down, Isabella snaps a small silvered pendant to your collar, the laser engraving upon it reading *Property of Isabella Naram-Sin.*

Taking your leash again, she guides you to your feet.  "Come on," she smiles, casually pressing her palm between your legs-- inducing a moan from you as your plugs tease your wet cunt so readily.  "We have a train to catch."

"A reverence..." he seems to bite down on a comment, instead waving for you to abandon the posture.  "Please, please-- that is not necessary.  Unwanted, even.  Offworlder, right?  Please do not think you need to practice such abhorent customs in my presence, I am very much *not* Torean.  I'm not sure how long you've been on this planet, ma'am, or what you've been subjected to... but I can assure you, I am one of the few men on this planet who will not take advantage of your situation.  The Liberty Society is here to help.

It's hard to ignore how naturally tall he is, despite your heels helping the situation somewhat. (if: $Level is 1)[With your hobble chain, you couldn't escape him if you wanted.](if: $Level is > 1)[In your armbinder and hobble chain, he's just naturally masculine enough to do anything he wished with you.](if: $Sec is true)[And standing next to him, you feel for the first time just how feminine your laminate skirt and blouse are.]

Michael doesn't seem to notice your staring, but nods enthusiastically.  "The Liberty Society, yes!  We are a coalition of individuals, interest groups, and corporate donors who all share a deep concern for the women of Torei-- both those born to the planet, and Offworlders like yourself!  You're a prime example of our cause, in fact!"

[["I'm an example?"->Offworlder Greet 4]]


:: Offworlder Greet 4
"Very much so!"  Michael asserts.  You're getting the sense that he is just naturally this energetic.  "You're an offworlder, as I said, right?  I can tell... at least, for awhile.  After a few years, after you've been forced through the Ministry of Improvements, after so many lessons and punishments and tribulations... you will change.  Become Torean in thought.  You're already Torean in dress.  What is your situation?"

You tell him-- a *bit*.  Yes, you're an offworlder here on business.  No, you haven't been on the planet for long.  And... yes, you did not exactly have a choice in everything you're wearing.

"I hope I will not offend you ma'am," he continues, "but do you understand how your situation looks, to us in the Society?  You're young, vibrant, a sharp eyed prospector on the fringes of know space.  An adventurer... who has become a victim of your own gender, captured by this planet and its culture."

He sweeps an arm down, indicating you in one bold movement.  "(if: $Blue is true)[Forced to give up your modesty, your body sealed into tight blue laminate.

He shakes his head.  "But... there must be something the Society can do for you?"

[["There is, actually..."->Offworlder Greet 5]]


:: Offworlder Greet 5
You explain more of your situation, at least regarding your battered memory and desire to get into Grand Aekora proper.  A desire that would greatly helped by a financial contribution.  The male seems empathetic, but his smile turns a bit strained.

"Getting downtown is a good idea, a high speed rail line can take you from there to the Way Up in a matter of moments.  Then you can ascend, and leave behind this planet."

Michael shifts on his feet.  "But... the Liberty Society is primarily concerned with generating awareness.  We do not have the resources to provide assistance to *every* freewomb, or slave, who comes to us.  We triage cases, and some that we deal with are... nevermind."

[["Then what can you do?"->Offworlder Greet 6]]
[["That's not helpful at all."->Offworlder Greet 6]]


:: Offworlder Greet 6
"I can still help!" Michael asserts, raising both hands.  "While I cannot address the *exact* details of your situation, the Liberty Society does have several programs that could interest you."

(if: $Level is 3 or 4)["Perhaps most immediately, we do provide financial assistance for the early removal of debt-related... adjustments, made to any woman.

Were it up to us this would be provided free of charge, our donations covering the early-release fees... but Torean law does not allow debt assumption of that sort.

You will need to pay for a *portion* of the cost yourself.  But it's very small!  Only 50 credits."]

The man rests his hands on his hips.  "I could certainly provide financial assistance from my small personal stipend, if you were willing to help with some of our awareness campaigns-- there are three opportunities right there!  First, we're collecting interviews from freewombs such as yourself who are living on this planet.  I'd give you 25 credits for that.  Second, we're collecting pictures as well-- although given the nature of those I could pay quite a bit more... say 100 credits?  And there is one more, although it requires a bit of walking... and you are in those heels.  Are those comfortable?  Nevermind.  What it entails, anyway, is asking for donations from anyone of importance around here.  You would be given another 100 credits for that."

He rubs his hands together.  "So-- what can I do for you?"

[[Opportunities about!->Offworlder Hub]]


:: OffNip
For a moment, he looks to your chest, but quickly draws his gaze back up to meet your eyes.  "I'm deeply sorry you had to undergo the application of such things," Michael commiserates.  He sounds quite genuine.

"If you're capable of paying that small 50 credit fee, I can get those removed for you.  And even if you don't have the credits right now, I want you to know there is no shame in being outfitted with... *them.*  On Torei, it's a very common thing for women-- slaves and Freewombs alike-- to eventually be *improved*, as a Torean would declare, in such a way.  And as things go, they're... relatively minor.  The Society has helped-- if you will excuse my using the Torean term-- *painslut* with far more then what you're enduring."

Michael nods, rubbing his hands together.  "Absolutely.  With outfits, we generally have to go to a wardrobe to have something removed.  But accessories?  I can cut that off you in just a few moments.  I bet that would feel *quite* good, huh?  That looks to be a particularly strict one, I cannot imagine how your shoulders must be feeling.  I hope no one has tried to take advantage of you either, with your arms pinned like that it's so hard to do *anything.*"

Going to his backpack, he returns with a particularly heavy-duty looking set of shears.  "You will still need to pay that 50 credit fee, of course."

(if: $debt is >= 50)[[["I've got 50 credits right here.  Get this thing off of me!"->RemoveArm2]]]


:: OffInterview
His enthusiasm for the topic is immediate.  "Ah, so you're interested in the interview?  Great!  Or perhaps you're justing looking for more details?  Well-- the Society publishes a quarterly report on our work here, planetside.  Mission goals and achievements, financial spending, that sort of thing.  But we also have a section reserved for what we call *the voices of Torei*.  Testamonies from the Torean-born, or freewombs like yourself.  Anyone who has been subjected to the horrors of Torean culture!  Wait here."

Moving to his backpack, he pulls forth a small recording device and a datapad of some sort.  Tapping a button, he peforms a quick microphone check, the machine repeating his words with a second press.  Clearly working as intended, he approaches you again.  "So, let me explain how this works-- it's really simple.  I will ask you a few questions, and you will answer the questions truthfully.  And I mean that-- don't say what you think the Society wants to hear, speak from your heart.  That's important, we categorize every *voice* added to our archives based on their views, I can tell you where you will be placed afterward."

He smiles, awfully handsome in the afternoon light.  "So-- how does that sound?  Pretty easy, right?  And then you will get your 25 credits.  I only wish I was authorized to give you more."

:: OffPhoto
"No catch!" Michael assures you, but you can read something else in his eyes.  A *'but'* was coming, and it doesn't take long.

"But we're aware it's a substantial enough sum.  There is a reason for that."  He pulls at his jacket's collar a bit, obviously uncomfortable.  "The photoshoot is supposed to generate awareness for slaves and freewombs, and the bondage you undergo here.  But the local authorities are, obviously, resistant to our activities.  It is not what we would prefer, but we have managed to achieve a compromise of sorts: they allow us to operate if we ensure our photoshoots and the like show *real* Torean scenarios.  That means no actors, nothing staged.  We've... acquired the services of a Governess, and just need volunteers to undergo her work for-- just until the photoshoot is completed!"

He gives you an apologetic look.  "Obviously, it can be difficult to find freewombs who are willing to become the face of Torei for hundreds of worlds, ma'am.(if: $Slave is true)[  Your mask would hide your identity somewhat, of course, but your name would still be included.]  Thus the 100 credits if you help our cause."

:: OffDonate
Your fellow offworlder raises a hand to his chin, apparently considering your offer.  He doesn't consider long.

"Yeah, I think you can.  Alright, here is how this works.  All you need to do is use your natural charm--" he pauses, eyeing your full laminate ensemble.  "I mean *talk* to people, and ask for donations to the Society.  Usually it works best if you have a personal connection with someone, you know, that you've done something else with them before.  So try that, explore a bit, see you can approach."

He takes you by the shoulder, a raised hand directed over the nearest rooftop.  In the distance the Transport Platform looms over most everything else in the district.  "Then there is one other spot I'd want you to hit.  Up on the Platform we have a permit for a small stand, for marketing or education or whatever we like.  Today it will be donation collection, with you heading it.  The literature and the signs mostly sell the idea themselves, but if anyone has any questions just encourage them to contact our hotline.  Sound good?  At the end, you come back to me, and you get a cut of whatever you collected.  Call it an incentive for good work!"

:: OffRemoveSuit
He looks over your enclosure suit with more empathy then desire, despite the way it demonstrates your every curve-- for any curious onlooker.  "That suit you're wearing... it's a travesty, I must say that first.  Between inventive Masters and the Ministry of Improvements, *much* worse fates can be found here on Torei, but there is something to be said for the ubiquity and effectiveness of your particular uniform.  It's designed to remove your identity, to make you just another black masked *doll*.  To have you focus on your body, your breath, your... desire, and not much else."

You have to agree with the effectiveness.  Were you given a bit of privacy, you're not sure if you could have resisted grinding your plugged cunt against the nearest solid thing.  Even then, in public like this, you find yourself constantly shifting your hips.  It's a lingering symptom Michael notices as well, but he only shakes his head slightly.

"I can get you out of it early-- but there are... complications.  The first being cost.  The Society can pay for your early emancipation, but Aekoran law requires that you pay an attendant fine yourself-- it's *clearly* designed to make just this sort of thing more difficult.  200 Credits is not easy to scrape together, not for a slave suited woman.  But if you bring me that, I can take you to a wardrobe and get you changed in something... still laminate, but as professional as can be managed.  Skirt, blouse, heels... you're a woman on Torei, you best get used to heels."

:: OffAsk
"Of course I am," Michael replies, any hint of mirth you may have suspected not surfacing.  "I would have to be blind not to... I mean, look around you.  Look at yourself.  It is... very distracting."

He looks out towards the other women walking past, a riot of colors and gloss.  "It would be so easy... you girls are all but *required* to give me whatever I desire.  The way it's expected that you perform reverence, the opportunities that come every night as your curfew starts... it's why the Society focuses on women exclusively.  Torei is not easy on you."

The taller man sighs a bit, shaking off the malaise with a spirited display of focus.  "I manage by keeping myself seperate.  No laminate whatsoever, even if finding laundry for textiles is... difficult.  And I focus on our mission.  The Ministry of Truants is..."

He smiles, looking away.  "Let's talk about something else."

[["Sure..."->Offworlder Hub]]


:: OffAskPass
Michael works a hand along the collar of his jacket, adjusting it slightly.  "As I'm sure you're aware, such a pass is not required of me.  I arrived here by train, in fact.  We of the Society refuse to patronize the carriages, and our cause is so much more necessary here-- a bit further from the Way Up.  I'd love to try again in the Antipodes, but if you think the cause is difficult here-- imagine Ringdoms with archaic technology, where Offworlders are so rare they don't even think to *question* slavery..."

Clearly its unthinkable to the man, and he brushes off any attempt to discuss the matter further.  Besides, he hadn't exactly answered your question.  "A pass, though.  I do have one, but it's reserved for someone else.  That's all I can say about it."

[[He's quite intent on that last point.->Offworlder Hub]]

You don't have to travel far-- Michael leads you down a nearby alley and through a door within.  You enter into what appears to be an office space of some sort, subdivided and rented out.  The Liberty Society's section is small, and currently deserted, but packed with supplies-- you get the clear impression Michael isn't its only member operating on Grand Aekora's outskirts.  Passing by several boxes of pamphlets much like the ones your escort had been handing out, you notice one of a different style, the name *Convent of Perception* written in stark letters along the top.

Your attention turns towards the back of the domicile, however, where a familiar device awaits-- a wardrobe, this one appearing to be mobile.  Michael works the control panel as you step up, the door gliding open before you.  Within, a dozen different armatures await.

[[Step forward.->Remove Suit 3]]


:: Remove Suit 3
You're seized as soon as you enter, the door snapping shut behind.  Much like the hotel's Wardrobe, this one has a drain in the bottom of the unit, its use revealed by the first stage of your re-dressing-- the removal.  Instead of peeling the laminate from your body, a simple solvant is applied by a spraying arm, and in mere moments the material is dripping off your body like so much wet paint.  

Removing your plugs is a different matter-- that requires a pair of arms to seize them directly, but as you squirm in your restraints they're pulled free from your tortured cunt.  You take a deep breath, the first in some time, as you are no longer masked.  A brief, tantalizing taste of nudity follows... but not for long.  With a fresh whirl, the Wardrobe begins working on your new outfit as a ring descends from above.

Thus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constained by your bodice.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molton laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.

Almost as an afterthought, makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.

(if: $Level is > 0)[The only remaining step is the reapplication of your bondage, the hobble chain at your ankles (if: $Level is > 1)[and armbinder behind you] being quickly build back up.]

Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

[[You emerge.->Remove Suit 4]]


:: Remove Suit 4
<img src="img/mEoSzB3.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">
(set: $Status to 1)
You step back out of the wardrobe, utterly transformed.  Once more you're allowed to breathe freely, regulation no longer being applied by mask and corset.  You've also been liberated from the consistent teasing of the infernal plugs, although curiously your tortured womanhood almost seems to ache from their absence.  Most importantly, though, you will no longer be recognized as little better then a slave-- the outfit you're now wearing instead at least approaches the Torean definition of *professional.*

It's a change that Michael clearly approves of immediately, a fact he demonstrates by giving you an enthusiastic thumbs up.

"Very good!  I wish we had more offworld textiles to give you, I know, but this will have to do.  I'm sure I don't have to remind you, but... do watch how you sit, ma'am.  That outfit does not come with panties."

He gestures for you to follow, and leads you back out into the alley, and then the street beyond.  His corner is much as you had left it, except for the half-circle of passersby avoiding Michael's attempts to speak with them-- something he is quick to reconstitute, returning to his job.

[[It feels good to feel the wind in your hair again.->Offworlder Hub]]


:: OffHobble
Michael nods, rubbing his hands together.  "Absolutely.  With outfits, we generally have to go to a wardrobe to have something removed.  But accessories?  I can cut that off you in just a few moments.  I bet that would feel *quite* good, huh?  Having every step restricted like that, I would imagine it must be easy to fall over.  And forget about running, or anything else that requires more then walking speed."

Going to his backpack, he returns with a particularly heavy-duty looking set of shears.  "You will still need to pay that 50 credit fee, of course."

[["I don't have that many credits.  Perhaps we can explore this later.->Offworlder Hub]]
(if: $debt is >= 50)[[["I've got 50 credits right here.  Get this thing off of me!"->RemoveHobble2]]]


:: RemoveArm2 [Debt]
As promised, the shears make short work of your armbinder.  Starting just behind your left shoulder, he slides the blade beneath the laminate, then works it upward.  The muscles and tendons that are freed from the enforced position behind your back nearly spasm from the sudden liberty, but already you can feel the harsh ache in your arms finally peak and begin to start coming down.
(set: $Level to 1)(set: $debt to it - 50)
Michael is all smiles, as he tosses the laminant remains in a nearby recycling chute.  "Great!  Remember-- we can address that hobble chain now, if you have another 50 credits.  If not, don't worry, I'll be here all day."

[[You work one of your arms in a slow circle.  Damn, that feels good.->Offworlder Hub]]


:: RemoveHobble2 [Debt]
It takes a bit of effort on Michael's part, but with a sudden snap he manages to cut through the laminate cord strung between your legs.  Removing the rest of the components is simple enough, and after a few more precise cuts the last bits fall away.  Michael disposes of them in a nearby recycling bin and you, for the first time in awhile, stretch your legs.
(set: $Level to 0)(set: $debt to it - 50)
"Happy to be of service, ma'am."  Michael smiles, returning to his pamphlets.  "Let me know if you need anything else from me, or the Liberty Society."

:: RemoveNip3
The Wardrobe Device may be mobile, but it's just as effective as the one you endured in the hotel.  The laminate clinging to your chest is removed by a solvant that precisely dissolves the material, momentarily leaving you topless as lasers cut the steel embedded in your chest.  A healing solution is applied afterward, intended to repair your nipples now that they're no longer studded.  Beyond that, you merely must wait for the suit to reproduce the laminate across your chest-- and you're free, emerging to Michael waiting expectantly.  

Again he looks to your chest, only to think better of it.  "Everything is... good?"  He asks, glancing away.  "If so, we can make our way back up.  And... maybe discuss getting that armbinder off of you?  That's an option now."

Michael moves his finger down his pad, obviously reading off a list.  "The second score grades-- I mean indicates, yeah, that's better... it indicates your level of *defiance* to Torean social norms."

"I feel the need to confirm with you again," Michael hesistates.  You get the distinct feeling he considers the offer unsavory, despite the righteousness of the cause.  "I know that standards on Torei are... different, but it will still be intense for you.  The Society is required to get sign off from the Governess to use this material afterward, and... knowing their sort's reputation, she will be thorough in what she deems a proper representation of Torean culture.  I very much doubt she will ask for further consent, or harbor much of what one would call mercy.  A Torean Governess is fearsome indeed."

"Great..." he sighs.  "Well, luckily for you, we have a photo session going on right now.  We will need to move to the Society's local operating base.  Governess Yennifer should already be there, working with the two other girls."

Michael grabs his backpack, slinging it casually over one shoulder as he leads the way.  "Oh, did I not mention the other girls?  Obviously, we're trying to get a few different volunteers.  Different perspectives, reactions, things like that."

He leads you through the streets, the passing crowds of women parting before him-- at least it's easy to follow in his wake.  Eventully you divert into an alley, then a door that enters into what appears to be an office space of some sort, subdivided and rented out.  The Liberty Society's section is small, and currently deserted, but packed with supplies-- you get the clear impression Michael isn't its only member operating on Grand Aekora's outskirts.  Passing by several boxes of pamphlets much like the ones your escort had been handing out, you notice one of a different style, the name *Convent of Perception* written in stark letters along the top.

Your attention turns towards one of the myriad side doors, however, as Michael leads you through several.  After the third, you come face to face with another woman waiting beside yet another door, her expression troubled.  Her dress is black, and she looks worried.
(set: $debt to it +100)(set: $debtSlave to true)(set: $TruantQuestPamph to true)
"Are they nearly done?" Michael greets.

The woman shakes her head.  "She hasn't even allowed the cameras to start yet, hells-- it's been three hours for the first girl, nearly two for the second.  That... *harpy* says she has to get the girls warmed up.  Michael, I do *not* like this."

Michael only sighs again, a hand gently on your back as he guides you towards the door.  "Just head on in," he instructs you, opening the final door.  As you step through, he moves towards the woman, most of his words lost as he lowers his voice.

"...for the best... knew she would be harsh... can only help keep tourists away..."

[[That doesn't sound promising.  Step through the door.->OffPhoto4]]

The man leans back a bit.  "Right, your... memory issues.  Well, many households and organizations on this planet can get very large.  And Torean culture, regrettably, generally involves a variety of unconscionable things be done to women associated with, working in, or enslaved by those groups.  Obviously leaders, be they CEOs or household heads, cannot manage such practices wholely by themselves.  Thus the Governess-- they're usually enslaved themselves, but serve as overseers."

[["That makes sense, I suppose.  Should we get to it?"->OffPhoto3]]

<img src="img/ueFwYim.jpg">

"What do we have here...?"  The voice rings out as you enter a larger room, the majority of it draped with a heavy white laminate tarp.  Pulled tight along the walls and floor, it serves as a stage towards which a half-dozen cameras are arrayed.  They sit idly, but the woman who had addressed you is anything but.

Her outfit is uniformally black, a long sleeved laminate leotard that exposes plenty of the pale flesh between her hips and the knee high boots she is perched upon.  The cut of the outfit is low, exposing the tops of her breasts, a heavy strap running just above them.  Above *that* she is securely collared, a hint of submission amongst so much dominance.

(if: $Strike is >= 8)["Ah," she purrs, her advance towards you marked by a bold stride and snapping heels.  Her bright red lips curl into a smile, the one hint of color between her uniform and black hair.  "I *know* you.  We met on the street!  Such a small... delightful world.  And now you're another naughty slut!"](else:)["Ah," she purrs, her advance towards you marked by a bold stride and snapping heels.  Her bright red lips curl into a smile, the one hint of color between her uniform and black hair.  "Another naughty *slut.*"]

Who she meant by 'another' requires only a glance beyond the Governess.  In the center of the makeshift stage, three poles run from ceiling to floor.  Two are... occupied.

In the center a girl in a pink laminante dress has her hands bound behind her back, a shiny ring gag pressed between her teeth, forcing her mouth open.  The cups of her dress have been pulled down, both revealing her pierced nipples and stripping her of anything approaching dignity.  Her expression is a mixture of frustrated and distraught, but it takes you a moment to recognize *why* beyond the obvious causes-- but you eventually do notice a laminate cord, running down from the top of her pole, then down behind her back.  Just what purpose that cord served is demonstrated by the second woman.

Much like the first, this second unfortunate has her own pole, her hands bound behind her back.  Her laminate outfit is a pale blue, her breasts likewise exposed.  Unlike her compatriot in bondage, however, she isn't standing angrily-- she's *hanging*.  Her legs are folded up, straps encircling her thighs (and thus her calves), one to each side her pole.  And the cord from above?  She doesn't have a skirt to hide the fact that it was connected to a heavy device currently installed in her ass, supporting her weight entirely.  Her head is bowed, drool running from her gagged mouth to the floor.

"Don't be so *shy*," the black-clad woman interrupts, seizing you by the throat.  She's strong, stronger then you would have expected of her.  Truly, did Torean biotechnology have any limits?

"What have they sent me?"

Her free hand glides over your laminate hips.  "(if: $Blue is true)[Another freewomb in blue, but I do say-- the restraints on this one are quite agreeable.  The collar suits you.

She pivots, resting her arm across your shoulders.  You get the sense she has absolutely zero sense of personal space.  Together you look towards the three poles, and two bound girls.  The Governess' black lips slide into a wicked grin.  "Ready to join them?"

"Already submissive," she purrs.  "That's a good start."

She leads you forward, approaching the woman in the middle.  Raven haired and pretty, her opened mouth drools a bit onto the floor, her eyes trying to stay focused.  This much closer, you can see the telltale red marks of some device-- whip or crop-- along her flanks.  She's standing on her toes, barely, the toes of her boots barely managing to hold her steady.  That last bit, *steady*, is demonstrated to be quite important when the Governess uses her shoulder to push her to the side.  She pivots, moaning desperately, without the footing to halt the process despite her muted attempts to do so.  

"Your ID indicates you're... quite new to Torei," the Governess explains, flicking the thick laminate cord to which the steel that emerged from the girl's ass attached.  The cord thrums in response, and so does your fellow freewomb, the sound pleading.  "You've probably not seen an anal hook in person, but that's what is buried inside her.  An *excellent* tool if rigged correctly.  Perfect for what those fool Offworlders think they're getting here."

The bound girl's wriggling ceases, her breathing heavy.  Her moans turn towards something else, a concerted attempt to communicate.  It sounds unintelligble to you, but the Governess has the experience to translate.

"She wants her pole now, in full," the Governess cups her cheek, smiling with those bright red lips.  "I knew we would get there.  In just a moment, dear."

"It's a technique," she explains, leading you again, stepping towards the other bound woman.  "That few Freewombs experience, unless they get a proper collar.  This is a breaking pole, and it's *torture*."

The final woman is as you glimpsed her before-- bound like the previous, but with her legs lifted, knees a few feet from the floor.  Supported solely by the hook, you also notice something lodged in her exposed womanhood-- the obvious base of cock, churning relentlessly.

"Present," the Governess commands, and the bound girl instantly complies.  Her face is covered by the fall of her hair and she doesn't raise it now, but she does arch her back, pressing out her chest.  It's an effect that clearly takes some effort, the girl moaning lewdly.

"Good *slave*.  Do you want down?"

The freewomb shakes her head *no*, barely perceptible compared to the line of drool that runs down onto her own chest.  The Governess seems ready to continue, but a sharp snap suddenly sounds, replacing the hum of the vibrator lodged within the girl.  A shock.

"Almost orgasmed," comes the commentary.  "Come, let's get you setup on yours."

You may have grown accustomed to your laminate by now, but the Governess is so much *more*.  Faster to react then you had expected, still so much stronger, and with a discerning eye towards the restrictions upon you-- manipulating the interplay of fashion, laminate, and details like heels with ease.  You barely make it two steps.

"This isn't acceptable, but I can see you're the sort of Offworlder who *needs* this.  Don't you want to look proper for your photos?"

And then you're ignored.  The Governess shifts her attention back to the girl in the middle, leaving you awkwardly bound, a line of drool running from your gagged mouth.  It's almost... frustrating?  Did you want to be freed, though, or merely the Governess' attention?

It's something you consider as the pink laminated girl loses her right to stand, instead submitting to her pole completely with a moaned whimper.  As reward-- or perhaps merely to serve as further torture-- she too is given a vibrating insert.  It takes only a few moments for the first whip-crack like snap to emit from the device, preventing an orgasm as the girl wriggles helplessly on her hook with a delirious moan.

Your world, meanwhile, has grown so very small.  Escape is out of the question, and who *knows* what else the Governess planned.  You have but two choices: to resist, or to submit-- and one goal.  *Endure.*

You resist.  Stepping forward you force yourself to the limits of your bondage, moaning a gagged demand for release.  Stepping forward only shifts your anal hook, however, and the Governess never meets your eyes.  What concern are you worthy of now?  Do you think you're worthy of attention?

It doesn't matter-- the Governess is not looking for your compliance.  She demands only that you undergo her ministrations.  They come in the form of a laminate whip, the thick-wrapped handle descending into a handful of thin strands.  You're the only flagellant, and she does not give you mercy.  Even your gagged shouting is ignored as she works you over, the hook upon which you're perched pulling ever deeper inside you as you're commanded to turn, exposing your rear to the same means of punishment.  This is even worse, in fact, as without the protection of laminate your tender flesh is all the more exposed.

Your eyes drop towards the floor, trying to smooth your own passage forward.  At least the girl in pink laminate had tried the path of resistance, and look what that had got her-- little more then a harder route to the same destination.  A Torean Governess could not be beaten, not at something like this.  You submit.

You try to disrupt her work whenever you can-- anticipating her strikes to turn your flank, at least lessening the effect of repeated whips upon the same section of flesh or laminate.  Again, however, it hardly seems to matter to the Governess.  You do not have unlimited real estate to give, and she appears in no rush-- instead merely continuing until you're *forced* to present areas of your rear that burn from the resultant attention.

After several sharp strikes to your cunt she then suddenly changes tactic, seizing upon a thick, phallic piece of laminate that she holds to your mouth.  Still gagged with the ring between your teeth, you're in little position to prevent her cock from being shoved in.  Deep, deeper then you have ever known.  Back all the way to your throat, the triggering of your gag reflex only narrowly avoided.  You're left panting, utterly violated, as she nonchalantly switches back to the whip.

It may hurt like *hell*, and your sense of dignity still screams from the dark corner you shove it into, but you are too keen to not notice a losing scenario when presented with one.  The Governess is in no rush, and you are in no position to negotiate.  What was the point in drawing out the inevitable?  It's a question you're forced to ask yourself again and again as she works you over with the whip, focusing the snapping licks upon particular sections of your body that soon burn, so very raw, as a result.

You lose track of time, and the harsh treatment only continues.  Soon you're slick with sweat, panting in the moments she does not have that cock jammed between your lips.  Somewhere along the way she pauses, only to focus instead on one of your legs.  Lifting it, she secures it in a folded position behind your thigh with a thick laminate strap.

The Governess ceases her work, turning those hands that had tortured you so to your cheeks, directing your gaze into her's.  "You want the full pole?"

You nod, the only option left to you.  That had always been the goal.  She directs you carefully, pulling up your leg, then securing it.  Your full weight now rests on the hook.  The vibrator follows, being slid between your legs without any sort fanfare.

"You will *not* be allowed to cum," the Governess reminds you.

The vibrator is cold, but your cunt takes it in willingly.  You know what's coming next.  The hum, the undulating sensations that drive pleasure up between your legs... until you near that crest, and the inbuilt shock device knocks you back down.

It's only then the Governess is satisfied.  You're lost to the pole as she finally allows the cameras to capture your torment, preserving in digital form what true Torean submission looked like.

He does as he promises, guiding back out of the apartment-like complex, back onto the Torean streets.  So you're just another woman among the many making their way, so many colors and heeled boots snapping against the pavement.  Returning to Michael's customary corner, he releases you.

She all but forces you anyway, as you try to figure out what exactly you had done wrong.  The Ministry of Truants-- you may have heard of them-- did *not* have a good reputation on Torei.  They were efficent, well-staffed and supplied, that wasn't the problem.  No, they were *feared* by many freewombs precisely because they were so good-- a less thorough organization may have been less strict with the myriad of laws and regulations that could quickly find a freewomb like yourself in trouble.

"Good," the Officer continues.  Reaching out, her hands glide down your laminate oufit, frisking you.

After that, the officers leave you alone.  A few more slaves in similar attire, or obviously collared, are added to your small collection but mostly they focus on processing the freewombs pulled from the checkpoint.  It leaves you with little to do but watch the passing crowds, and focus on the growing discomfort rising from your bonds.  Of the former, you do start to recognize a pattern in those they take for further questioning in the alley-- they seem to be using a scanner in one of the Ministry vehicles to check IDs from afar, a smattering of overheard conversation revealing they seemed to be looking for those with recent ID alterations.  Of the latter?  Your shoulders ache, your neck throbs, and breathing remains a challenge.  

It takes quite some time for the officers to address the slaves, and even then you're hardly first in line.  By the time they reach you several hours have passed, and even then you are not given much in the way of conversation-- an officer approaches, and begins frisking you.  She is not gentle, nor does she care about your dignity.  Her hands move all across your tightly bond form, between your legs, checking your (if: $Level is 3 or 4)[pierced] breasts, even examining the lacing of your corset.  Only *then* does she check your ID.

"A freewomb," she notes, sounding only a bit surprised.  "Must be quite the slut to have ended up locked in there.  I'm going to unlock you."  She does, removing the Ministry-stamped components of your bondage.  Even still, your suit and its accessories are restraint enough.

Advancing further, you lose sight of the gate-- the plot of land may be small, but the wave-like foliage seems to encompass all, smothering you in its embrace.  Stepping past a particularly thick trunk-analogue, you catch sight of movement.  A figure, kneeling in a small clearing.

Her hood casts a deep shadow over her eyes, but you notice they seem to be red as well-- giving her gaze an inhuman cast.

"Welcome(if: $Slave is true)[, Sister]."  Her voice is soft, as if each word is carefully considered.  The laminate across her lips muffles the effect somewhat.  "Welcome to our Convent."

"Mhm," the Sister purrs, crossing the distance before you.  She's tall-- *very* tall, even with your heels you barely make it to her shoulder.  "Many are called to the Convent, even if they cannot place the reason why.  It matters not(if: $Slave is true)[, Sister].  All are welcome."

She pauses, those red eyes searching out your own.  When they meet, she gazes deeply, leaving you with a chill sensation running up your spine.

"You intend to travel," Euphoria concludes.  "But you lack the means."

[["How did you know?  Yes, I need to get Downtown."->NunGreet4]]
[["That means... credits, yes."->NunGreet4]]


:: NunGreet4
The quiet Sister, this Torean Nun, seems to smile beneath her muzzle.  You definitely get the sense of lips shifting beneath the laminate.  "As I said, many come to our Convent in dire need.  Few *truly* understand what it is they seek... but we can provide.  You need credits?"

It almost seems strange to discuss such mundanities with this almost otherworldly woman, but she takes to the topic readily.

"Credits are but a means to a particular end, and perhaps not even the most appealing end available to you.  What you *need* is the opportunity to consider your situation.  The Convent can provide both.  Indulge me(if: $Slave is true)[, Sister], with a dedication towards reflection and prayer.  A few hours.  Perhaps that will help you on your path.  Even if it does not, the Convent will provide you alms.  We offer four programs of prayer: Contemplation, Sensation, and Revelation.   Contemplation and Sensation will reward you with 50 credits apiece.  Revelation another one hundred... if you make it that far."

:: NunGreet5
Euphoria turns away from you, casting her gaze over one shoulder now.  "The Convent has other needs, of course, beyond your own preceptions.  We always accept charity, and there is another task we could discuss if you wish."

She kneels again in the clearing, head bowing.  "But for now?  Consider the paths before you.  They *are* myriad."

[[A quiet breeze blows through the alien trees.->Nun Hub]]


:: NunGreetAsk
"Perceptive," the Nun notes.  "A good sign.  The fourth program is Conversion, an entirely different undertaking."

Those bright red eyes seem to flash, perhaps a play of light across them.  "Are your needs that dire?  Perhaps we will see."

[["I... understand, I think."->NunGreet5]]


:: AskSister
"Perhaps you have noted my collar," the Nun replies, still kneeling.  She doesn't even look up.  "Much as I have noted your own.  Is it not a divine feeling?  To be marked so readily as subservient, as a *thing* that can be owned?  This is what makes us Sisters, a bond stronger then blood.  You may be a Freewomb by designation, but you stray close enough.  We perceive all slaves as Sisters."

[[Well, now you know.->Nun Hub]]


:: AskCon
Sister Euphoria's eyes open, the nun rising in a muted display of fluttering red laminate.  "Of course," she replies.  "The Convent of Perception is but one sanctum maintained by the Order of the Primrose, but I can address most anything you desire."

She leans in, towering above you.  "What would you like to ask?"

[["I have no other questions, currently."->Nun Hub]]


:: AskPers
"You may ask... to a degree," the Sister replies, holding up one slender finger.  "You are correct in believing Euphoria is not my birth name, nor is it technically a name at all-- it is an eponym, a title of sorts for what we in the Order believe is important.  The Vow of Anonymity we take upon entering the Order strips us of our names and past identities, and our eponym change with some frequency."

The silence of the grove you both stand in grows momentarily oppressive, thick and foreboding.  It passes as Euphoria continues.  "The related Vow of Uniformity requires several stays with the Ministry of Improvements, adjusting our bodies towards identicality with each other.  Thus the red of my eyes, which it turn symbolizes yet another Vow... but I digress, theology can be quite convoluted and entwined at times.  Suffice it to say, that is as much as I can tell you regarding myself.  To do more would be to Sin."

[["I understand, but I do have other questions?"->Nun Hub]]


:: NunContem
Sister Euphoria rises from her kneeling position, sleek and graceful despite the cloak and her heels.  She's also considerably taller now that she stands over you, a fact you cannot help but consider as you look up into those red eyes.

"You think you seek the 50 credits I have promised," she replies, mouth just perceptible beneath the laminate of her muzzle.  "But perhaps you will find other paths as well, in this pursuit.  You will need nothing but an open mind, and several hours to spare.  Do you find such terms acceptable?"

[["On second thought... let me reconsider."->Nun Hub]]
[["Yes I do."->NunContem2]]


:: NunSens
The Sister rises, looming above with her red-eyed gaze.  A study in contradiction: intense, yet serene.  "*Sensation.*  Perhaps the most fundamental component of perception.  Raw.  Primal.  Well worth exploration, and for some of our lay adherents... the most commonly repeated program we offer."

Stepping towards you, even her gait is carefully considered-- one foot in front of the other, hips swaying back and forth.  Alluring.

"I do recall promising you 50 credits for experiencing the topic nevertheless.(if: $NunCon is true)[ You have already undergone Contemplation, at the very least you know the nature of our Convent.  Some of what you perceive will be familiar, but much will be new.]"

[["On second thought... let me reconsider."->Nun Hub]]

:: RevelationNO
The Nun remains kneeling, her hands clasped before her.  Picture-perfect religiosity, in the Torean mold.  "Revelation is an intensive program experience, and one that requires some experience with Sensation and Contemplation.  Return to me when you have completed the other programs, and we can explore Revelation."

[[Prerequisites?  Is this a religion or a University?!->Nun Hub]]


:: ConvertNO
The heavy laminate garters running from the Sister's corset to her stockings strain momentarily, as the kneeling woman adjusts her position.  She does not open her eyes, despite responding.  "We do offer a fourth program, that of Conversion.  For obvious reasons, it is a rare day indeed that we come across someone who *needs* guidance down that particular path."

Her head bows further.  "Prayer and service are the only means to even *approach* such things."

[["O-Okay.->Nun Hub]]

(if: $Slave is false)["A simple enough thing," the Sister responds, opening her eyes.  They find you as she rises with considerable grace, despite the heavy corset she wore.  "One of our Sisters is arriving from another Convent today, via the local transporation hub.  We require someone escort her here."

Her long sleeves pull apart, revealing the black of her gloves underneath.  "Once you return, the Convent will compensate you for the time and effort.  100 credits, perhaps?"

[["I've done enough walking today, no thanks.->Nun Hub]]
[["Why does she need an escort?->Pickup2]]](if: $Slave is true)["I am sorry, Sister," the Nun responds, opening her eyes.  "But the nature of the task requires a freewomb in good standing, and by the laws of this Ringdom you are under too many of the Slave Codes to sate that requirement.  If you were to escape your current predicament we could perhaps discuss this again, and the 100 credit reward the Convent is offering.  But until then?  We can only take solace in our collars."

[["I understand".->Nun Hub]]]


:: NunRevelationYES
The Nun remains kneeling, her head still folded in prayer.  "Revelation is not something one embarks upon lightly, (if: $Slave is true)[Sister](else:)[child].  By its very nature, Revelation is a public affair.  Display, confession, contemplation, and sensation-- all have a role to play in such a ritual.  We do not ask it of the weak-willed."

She turns to regard you, her red eyes so vibrant beneath the shadow of her habit.  "It *is* something frequently required of members of my Order, however.  I can attest to it being a harrowing experience, yet enlightening.  We will reward you 100 credits for such an effort, regardless."

"I do not," the Sister replies, still kneeling.  "Such things require many credits, or influence.  We in the Convent take vows of poverty, of service, of anonymity.  Thus?  Such a pass is beyond us.  We utilize the Lead."

"Ah, a proper question to ask, considering where we stand."  Sister Euphoria's arms stretch out, the tight cling of most of her uniform offset by the loose draping of her cloak.  "You are standing in the vestibule of the Covenent of Perception."

She gestures towards a set of doors on the far side of the small clearing, mostly obscured by the wave-like leaf-analogues.  "Through there would be our chambers of prayer, open to all those will to submit to a particular program.  Contemplation, Sensation, and Revelaton being offered here.  Further in would be the Order's chambers, and other more private prayer areas.

"The Order maintains a number of Covenants such as this across Torei, each dedicated to a particular ideal and serving a variety of public programs.  As a whole the Order is dedicated to achieving Bliss, but approaching such things directly is very difficult.  Thus the ideals, where Sisters can contemplate and explore individual facets of the greater whole more readily.  Our ideal here, as the name suggests, is *Perception.*"

"The Order of the Primrose is the greater faith to which I, and all our Sisters, ultimately serve.  It is... ancient, from the time of the Sharecropping Wars-- the conflict that ultimately broke the majority of the Torean population from AI control.  Freed from our Gods, we sought new perspectives, new faiths.  One of these became our Order, dedicated to the exploration of *Bliss.*

"Pleasure can be easy to find here on Torei, but rarely does that alone bestow contentment.  Thus *Bliss*, a sublime state of physical pleasure, mental contentedness, and societal stability.  It is divinity incarnate, the goal of every Torean soul.  And we assist those seeking Bliss, however can.  Alms, prayer, sanctums for study.  There is no set path to Bliss, but witht he proper guidance all roads do lead to it.  Those that do not we know as Sin."

[["Sin?  Your Order has a concept of Sin?"->AskSin]]
[["Interesting.  I want to ask about something else."->AskCon]]


:: AskGarden
"Ah," she looks up, towards the strange boughs of the nearest tree, and the heavy canopy overhead.  "Of course.  Were you aware that Torei is a new planet, but most galactic standards?  Formed artificially by the AIs, a long time ago by our count, but in a mere blink in the cosmic eye.  These... let us call them trees are from that primordial time.  Have you noticed how they seem to stop... everything?  Wind, sound, *perception.*  We believe they were originally bred by the AI Gods to shield their first agricultural work upon the surface."

Reaching out, Euphoria uses a gloved hand to grab a wave-like branch.  It snaps with only the barest of effort, as if sheared off. "They are brittle, but resiliant to weather.  And with such strange properties.  These days only a few copses exist out in the Badlands.  Those who travel such paths call them *Silent Escorts* given how often they are found watching over patches of water.  Here at the Convent, they serve much the same purpose-- escorting us Sisters from the predations of sin."

:: AskOrder
"Our Order is old, but not very large," the Sister muses, the fullness of her chest made evident as she folds an arm beneath, resting her other on its elbow as she does some quick math with her free hand.

"Perhaps five thousand, across the surface of Torei.  We *do* have a claim to being widespread, at the very least.  Serving at a Convent here, so close to the Way Up, is quite a different experience from a Convent deep in the Antipodes."

[["Interesting, I have other question.->AskCon]]

The collar in question is tight against her throat, thinner along the top and flaring a bit towards the shoulders.  It doesn't look comfortable.

"You are asking if I am a slave," she deduces, tilting her head slightly to the side.  Her hood follows, running down her back like glossy hair.  "I am.  All members of the Order are."

Lifting her arms allows the long sleeves to slide down somewhat, revealing cuffs locked onto her wrists.  A second set is visible on her ankles.

"When a prospective Sister joins the Order as a Noviatiate, she is enslaved to our Benefactor.  It's a temporary arrangement at first, but upon one's Confirmation it is made both lifelong and irreversible.  Thus we commit ourselves wholely to the exploration of Bliss, and the rejection of Sin.  It is the Vow of Service, but just one of many we must take-- others being the Vow of Poverty, the Vow of Femininity, and the Vow of Anonymity.  There are optional ones as well, such as the Vow of Silence, or that of Chastity."

"The Path to Bliss is always open, for those with the conviction to walk it," Euphoria replies, blinking slowly.  It's not hard to imagine she must be quite beautiful beneath that muzzle.  "We offer that program, that of Conversion, here.  But it is a hard path, and most Novitiates drop out when given the opportunity just prior to Confirmation."

Her lithe shoulders rise and fall, a a serene shrug.  "But if you work through our programs, and if you think you have the resolve, perhaps we could discuss it more later."

[[Not exactly a glowing endorsement, but a viable path nevertheless?  "I want to ask about something else."->AskCon]]


:: AskPercp
"Mhm," the red-eyed woman purrs.  "A good question.  And often debated here, in these very halls.  Perception is much like a triangle, I believe.  Three sided, each component necessary to maintain the whole, but abstract and strange-- mere lines-- without the others."  

The Sister mimics drawing a triangle in the space between you, her black gloves so very dark against the red of her cloak sleeve.  "The first side is how we perceive ourselves, both via the sensations we experience, and through our individual acts of judgement.  The second side is how others perceive us, and much akin to the first-- split between that which others observe, and how they react to our choices.  And the third?  That one is more... theoretical.  Difficult to grasp.  It is the sense of perception we have for what our *other* senses have already perceived.  An... esotoric concept, but one I think can be explained with an example.  Imagine you have cut your hand.  The first side is the pain you feel, and how you worry others will react to such a wound.  The second side is the *actual* reaction others have, and how they *think* you feel about the cut.  The third side, then, is how you perceive that sensation of pain, of concern for others.  Are you scared?  Ashamed?  Angry?"

Her gloved hands collect again before her waist.  "Thus... *perception.*"

[["I see...->AskCon]]


:: AskSin
"We do."  The Sister looks down at you, momentarily searching your eyes.  Whatever she's looking for, she doesn't find it.

"Sin is the antithesis of bliss.  The abolisment of pleasure, dissatisfaction of the mind, or chaos in society.  It is something to avoid, to abhor from afar.  But that is not always possible, and in *those* circumstances corrective action must be taken."

It's a firm line, yet delivered without a break in the Sister's serene attitude.  "We recognize the Order cannot take sides, however.  Cannot fix the world.  Thus we address only that which we can-- our Sisters.  Those outside of it we merely guide.  The same is applied to the Ringdoms we inhabit, we do not seek to upset their laws or means of governance."

[["Hmm, I see.  I want to ask about something else."->AskCon]]


:: AskBenny
The Nun nods, the thick septum ring piercing her nose shifting slightly.  "Another ancient tradition.  Legal traditions in most Ringdoms hold that for one to be a Slave, there must be a Master.  Our Benefactor would be that Master, although few Sisters ever actually meet him.  He is a Lord in an Antipodal Ringdom, and rarely travels.  We Sisters actually operate the Order, and manage ourselves according to our own Hierarchy."

[["Every slave a master, it does make sense, I suppose.  I have other questions."->AskCon]]

"We do not," Euphoria explains matter-of-factly.  "Unlike some religious sects, we are not so traditionalist that we reject the notion of male slavery as a *concept*, but the Order is open only to women."


[["Your overall beliefs, regarding masculinity then?."->AskMasc]]
[["Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions."->AskCon]]


:: AskMasc
"The Order of the Primrose is of Torei, a necessity given our divine task.  Bliss is formed by its surrounding circumstances, after all, making its presence on each planet virtually unique.  Thus our views on gender are somewhat traditionalist, following Torean standards.  We are of the view that, as women, we are by nature subservient.  Beings of sensuality.  Requiring guidance and direction, the sort only a collar can provide.  We are at our best on our knees, submitting to the masculine."

[["And, do you have male members?"->AskMale]]
[["The greater galaxy does not hold to those views, at ALL."->AskMasc2]]
[["Actually... let me think about it, I have other questions."->AskCon]]


:: AskMasc2
"The Order is quite aware," the much taller woman replies, unfaltering despite the potential sensitivity of the issue.  "The introduction of the greater galactic community to our planet has not shifted our views on this matter, however.  The Vow of Femininity addresses the subject directly."

[["I have other questions."->AskCon]]


:: NunContem2
"Then follow me."

Crossing the small clearing in which you had found her, the Sister leads you to where the strange trees ran up against the wall-- revealing a door obscured by a few wayward growths.  Pushing it aside, she uses one hand to open the door, her other gesturing for you to enter.

The door yawns deep and black, the subdued shadow of the garden descending into inky nothingness within.

Even those are wiped clean as Euphoria enters behind you, dragging shut the heavy door.  With its closure, you're plunged into a darkness more absolute then you had thought possible.

"This Convent is dedicated to Perception," the Sister explains, her hands falling on your shoulders.  Even whispering, her voice in your ear booms in the absolute silence.  "To better approach that ideal, we strip ourselves of all competing distractions.  Perception is as much what you do *not* perceive as that which you do."

The hands on your shoulders tighten slightly.  "Through my service, I have been made capable of guiding you," she intones, as you begin to walk.  The ground is some hard surface, but that's all you can tell.  "Our space for Contemplation is not far."

If you were expecting your eyes to adjust, they do not.  There are no windows, no portals to the outside beyond the one you entered.  Just *darkness*, and the laminate-clad Sister behind you.  It's only then you recognize, with sudden distraction, how *she* saw.  Those eyes, so unnaturally red.  Implants or something less invasive, it did not matter-- her vision had clearly been altered for just such environments.]

[[Accept her guidance.->NunContem4]]


:: NunContem4
As promised, it's not long before you begin to hear other things.  The sharp report of heeled boots upon the floor first, followed by the occasional sound of doors closing, of quiet voices in discussion or repeating verses before they're sealed off again.  Were you entering into... smaller rooms, perhaps?  *Cells?*  

The Sister breaks you from your wonderings, your fears.  "We approach your room.  Within it we will find a prayer frame, a device we use to ensure your body's posture follows your mind in total Contemplation.  You need only follow my instructs as we install you for the duration of this program.  Is that understood?"

Could a Sister of Euphoria's Order lie?  Would that be a Sin?  You're not giving the chance to question such things as her word proves true, the hiss of a door opening being followed by an order to halt, then kneel.

The *prayer frame*, as the Sister had named it, you obviously cannot see.  But as you're positioned, then strapped in, you at least get the sense of a metal frame to which a series of cuffs and chains are attached.  You in turn are attached to *them*, forcing you into the prescribed position for Contemplation.

Kneeling, your head is forced down by the collar, eyes fixated on a floor you cannot see.  (if: $Level is > 1)[Your armbinder is likewise locked into place in an uncomfortable, slightly raised position behind you.](else:)[Your hands are locked to seperate poles, then maneuvered closer, your palms connecting in a classic example of steeple-fingered prayer.]  Further down your knees are spread, the cuffed to the floor.

Then Euphoria leaves, closing the door on the way out.   It locks with a harsh *click.*  She explains nothing, nor does she instruct you further.  Instead you are left to the dark, to the silence, to your enforced posture, and your own thoughts.  *Contemplation* at its most pure.

Not to mention the belt around your waist ensuring you can be hooked to all manner of devices.] (if: $Brand is true)[You're covered in advertisements for slavery, strictly corseted and eternally perched on your toes.] (if: $Sec is true)[You're dressed like the office slut, in a clingy bodice and skirt that showed off so much leg.] (if: $Slave is true)[You're dressed as a slave, all black laminate.  Strictly corseted, and masked so that your breath is not even your own.]  (if: $Level is > 1)[Your arms are restrained](if: $Level is > 2)[, your nipples pierced].  This is not your first bit of bondage and depravity, nor will it be your last.  Torei is *getting to you.*

Liar.  Your memory may be punched full of holes, but you recall enough to know this is *not* normal.  Out there, in the greater galaxy beyond, you were proud!  Strong!  An independent prospector, a modern day treasure hunter living among the fringes of known space.  A pioneer, an explorer.

What are you now?

One of the undoubted millions locked into some bondage device on Torei, legs spread, eyes down.  The bondage, the humiliation, the laminate-- you've submitted to it all, bit by bit.  And it's getting easier.  Or... was it always this easy?  What exactly do you remember from your fragments of the... *week* before?

Good girl.  Your memory may be punched full of holes, but you recall enough to know this is *not* normal.  Out there, in the greater galaxy beyond, you were proud!  Strong!  An independent prospector, a modern day treasure hunter living among the fringes of known space.  A pioneer, an explorer.

What are you now?

One of the undoubted millions locked into some bondage device on Torei, legs spread, eyes down.  The bondage, the humiliation, the laminate-- you've submitted to it all, bit by bit.  And it's getting easier.  Or... was it always this easy?  What exactly do you remember from your fragments of the... *week* before?

[["Who are you?"->NunD3]]


:: NunD3
It's so much easier to focus without glistening bodies walking by, without staring eyes upon you in turn.  

Start from the beginning.  You remember the ride on the Space Elevator, the fabled Way Up... you were going *down*, right?  Or were you truly taking the *way up?*  Returning to the stars... or escaping to them for the first time?  The tenth?  You have no way to remember.  Perhaps this *isn't* your first week on the planet.  Others have commented on it, how easily you have taken the roles "forced" upon you.  Isn't everything easier with practice?

Now that would be something.  An alternate theory, at the very least.  Mem-Burn isn't the only means of changing one's memories on this planet, after all.  Much stronger options exist, the sort that blanked out *years*, leaving only those so very far back-- and those most recent, somewhat damaged.  Did you really check your room as thoroughly as you think you did?  If you *had* been planetside before, as a tourist, on another prospecting mission, or something else entirely-- that would make your ID a fake at the very least.  An assumed identity, a shadowy deal in motion.  Perhaps it *was* illegal.  Or dangerous.  Or both.

[["Either way, why would you bind yourself in your bedroom?"->NunD4]]


:: NunD4
You're not sure, hell, you're not really sure of anything right now.  Perhaps it hadn't been you, but someone else.

"But if it *had* been you?"

Then the selfbondage must have been intended to keep you there, until the countdown had ended-- tomorrow, beyond the date of the deal, before your ticket on the Way Up expired.  A narrow window, with a singular purpose.  Had you tried to stop yourself from completing the Black Card's deal?

"Something to contemplate further, I think."

Wait...

[[That wasn't you, that was a voice in the room...  Euphoria.  "Hello?"->NunD5]]


:: NunD5
"Hello, dear."  

It *was* her.  Had she snuck back in?  *How much of what you had just said had been at her prompting?*

"You do not need to worry," the Sister continues, her gloved hand finding your chin.  Her touch is soft, warm.  "It happens to everyone, their first couple times.  Denied so much of what we normally perceive, our minds wander.  Play tricks on us.  Do you know what time it is?  You've been in here for *hours*."

[["And was I speaking aloud?"->NunD6]]


:: NunD6
The hand on your chin drifts down, and begins to undo your bindings.  It's only then you realize just how sore you had become.  Your muscles certainly attested to hours having passed.

"Yes," she admits readily.  "We explored something you *needed* to contemplate, with a bit of guidance on my part.  A memory in such a state is liable to Sin.  You must be careful, whatever you choose to do going forward."

A final buckle frees you, and the Nun guides you upward, once again placing her hands on your shoulders for further direction through the fathomless black.  "You have my full confidentiality, regardless.  What we speak of in Contemplation is not to be repeated."

[["We never finished, we never figured out who I am."->NunD7]]


:: NunD7
"Contemplation rarely brings conclusion," Euphoria replies, guiding you through the sanctum of the Convent.  "But you have several possibilites.  You are either here for your first week, and merely... well attuned to Torei.  Or this is *not* your first time, and your dealings on this planet are less straightforward.  Then this note you hold, this Black Card?  Either you tried to keep yourself from following through on the deal, or someone else did and tried to hide that truth."

You can feel the heavy shackles on her wrists as she directs you around what must have been a corner.

"What happened *then* may very well be determined by your *Perception* of the now."

She pulls somewhere to your right, and suddenly the darkness breaks-- light.

[[You're back at the Front Door.->NunD8]]


:: NunD8 [Debt]
You emerge back out into the shadowed garden.  Compared to the absolute silence of the Convent, the garden seems almost alive with sound and light as you reaccustom yourself to a world beyond darkness.

Euphoria does not ask more of you, but merely returns to her kneeling position at the center of the small clearing.  As her hands fold together, she speaks once more.

"I hope you found Contemplation to be worthwhile.  The 50 credits will be in your account."
(set: $debt to it + 50)(set: $NunCon to true)

[["Thank you."->Nun Hub]]
[[Step back and away...->Nun Hub]]


:: NunSems2
"Follow, child."

Crossing the small clearing in which you had found her, the Sister leads you to where the strange trees ran up against the wall-- revealing a door obscured by a few wayward growths.  Pushing it aside, she uses one hand to open the door, her other gesturing for you to enter.

The door yawns deep and black, an abyssal void.

[[You step into the maw.->NunSens3]]


:: NunSens3
(if: $NunCon is true)[You have been within the Convent before, and know some of what comes next.  Behind you Euphoria closes the door, stripping the world of its last vestiges of light.  Darkess greets you, then overwhelms, leaving you blind.  But the Sister takes her position behind, hands on your shoulders.  Your guidance through this world of darkness.](else:)[You stand in a rectangle of light, the last vestiges of the world outside dwindling.  Even those are wiped clean as Euphoria enters behind you, dragging shut the heavy door.  With its closure, you're plunged into a darkness more absolute then you had thought possible.  All encompassing.

"This Convent is dedicated to Perception," the Sister explains, her hands falling on your shoulders.  Even whispering, her voice in your ear booms in the absolute silence.  "To better approach that ideal, we strip ourselves of all competing distractions.  Perception is as much what you do *not* perceive as that which you do."

The hands on your shoulders tighten slightly.  "Through my service, I have been made capable of guiding you," she intones, as you begin to walk.  The ground is some hard surface, but that's all you can tell.  "Our space for Contemplation is not far."

If you were expecting your eyes to adjust, they do not.  There are no windows, no portals to the outside beyond the one you entered.  Just *darkness*, and the laminate-clad Sister behind you.  It's only then you recognize, with sudden distraction, how *she* saw.  Those eyes, so unnaturally red.  Implants or something less invasive, it did not matter-- her vision had clearly been altered for just such environments.]

[[Accept her guidance.->NunSens4]]


:: NunSens4
As you traverse the gloom, blind to the world, sounds soon rise to meet you.  Whispers of... ecstasy.  Hungry panting, laminate being strained against, the muffled moan.  It grows louder with your every step until  you're enveloped in what could only be a gagged orgy.

Even so, Euphoria keeps her voice low, whispering in your ear.  "We have arrived at *Sensation*, as you no doubt can perceive.  You will find pleasure here, great deals of it.  But a lesson too, hopefully.  We have stripped you of sight, and other such restrictions will follow.  Voids in your perception, into which Sensation will enter.  Are you ready?"

[["Y-Yes."->NunSens5]]
[["What exactly are you going to do to me?"->NunSens5]]


:: NunSens5
"You will be locked into a position of prayer," she explains, guiding you towards the floor.  Indeed, you can feel a system of steel poles and heavy cuffs.  She works you into them slowly, securing each in turn.  Kneeling, your head is forced down by the collar, eyes fixated on a floor you cannot see.  (if: $Level is > 1)[Your armbinder is likewise locked into place in an uncomfortable, slightly raised position behind you.](else:)[Your hands are locked to seperate poles, then maneuvered closer, your palms connecting in a classic example of steeple-fingered prayer.]  Further down your knees are spread, then cuffed to the floor.  (if: $Sec is true)[As almost an afterthought, she then proceeds to hike up your skirt.]

"(if: $Slave is true)[Most are gagged, but your mask prevents this, Sister.  So you will moan for all to hear."](else:)[You will be gagged."  It's barely a warning as you feel a gloved finger at your lips, tapping there.  When you open, something between a ball and a phallic rod is quickly slide inside, lodging between your teeth.  It tastes of laminate and fills your mouth, pressing down upon your tongue.  You feel further laminate being pulled over your head, a panel and harness that undoubtedly fit much the same as the muzzle Euphoria herself wore-- only she was *not* gagged.]

Somewhere to your left, another woman can be heard moaning louding into her own gag.  Clearly, she's climaxing.

Euphoria remains unperturbed.  "The final component is your source of sensation.  Are you prepared?"

(if: $Slave is true)[[["Yes..."->NunSens6]]](else:)[[["Mmmgh."->NunSens6]]]


:: NunSens6
The pitch black of the Convent prevents you from seeing the Sister's movements, but you *can* sense her sliding something between your kneeling, spread legs moments before you actually feel it.  It's somewhat round, padded along the portions that contact against your thighs.  The component that rises at its apex, however, pressing against your womanhood?  That's angular, rounded.  An extended portion along the very front even reaches higher, seeking your clit.  (if: $Blue is true or $Brand is true or $Smoke is true)[And to ensure it is found, Euphoria pulls down your zipper.]  (if: $Slave is true)[It's impossible to ignore the sensation of your plugs pressed up against the hard portions of whatever the device is, and you cannot help but shift your hips, grinding into it with wet desire.](else:)[Immediately the device enters your wet cunt, sliding past eager lips.  It doesn't travel terribly deep, but quickly it becomes impossible to ignore.]

Especially once it starts vibrating.

(if: $Slave is true)[[["Oh, yes...!"->NunSens7]]](else:)[[["Hmmhgh!"->NunSens7]]]


:: NunSens7
Euphoria's hand briefly strokes along your head, then she's gone.

And you're left only with *Sensation.*

The device between your legs is not gentle, it does not tease.  It *churns*, pressing into your (if: $Slave is true)[plugs](else:)[cunt], drowning it in ecstatic vibrations.  Your body strains against its enforced posture of prayer without conscious direction, acting in vain against heavy cuffs and thick steel.

You moan loudly, adding your (if: $Slave is true)[voice](else:)[gagged voice], to the symphony of ecstasy that surrounds you on every side.  How many others joined you in this?  Perhaps dozens, although its impossible to tell.

Their voices are lost to you momentarily anyway as you climax, cumming hard against the vibrating device.  It doesn't respond, but keeps it pace, allowing you only a short afterglow before the Sensations build again...

(if: $Slave is true)[[[Take a deep breath through your mask.->NunSens8]]](else:)[[["Mmmghhh..."->NunSens8]]]


:: NunSens8
Pleasure unending.  

It's a fate you must confront blind, forced into a posture of prayer.  You cannot control the sensations, and you cannot escape them.  They merely *are*.  Whatever remained of your self-restraint soon slips through your fingers, as does your sense of time.  Everything is washed away by the buzz between your legs, the heady rush of endorphins that come as your cunt is put through its paces again, and again, and again...

[[You moan, then shift your hips, seeking out the Sensation despite it all.->NunSens9]]


:: NunSens9
You're not sure when exactly you realize it, time having become a nebulous construct to your ecstasy-riddled mind after all, but somewhere along the way you *do* sense a change.  Not in yourself, the pleasure between your legs continues to build and build until it bursts-- but in those around you.  They too were riding the high of their bondage, their prayer, their Sensations in *exactly* the same cycle as you're experiencing.

There are differences, of course, especially among those you hear brought it in after you.  Their gagged climaxes come quicker, rushing to screams of pleasure that take your now more well-worked cunt longer to reach.  But as time goes on, passing in whatever handfuls or leaps it was, everything seems to... sync up.  The purr of your devices, the strained moans you emit, the squirming orgasms.  

A dozens, dozens-- however many different souls, all brought into unison by this simple, primal act.  This *Sensation.*

[[You cum with them.->NunSens10]]


:: NunSens10
"Understanding," a voice suddenly whispers, so near.  After... so long without other stimuli, it nearly hurts to hear.  "I see it in your body, your expression.  You have reached a conclusion.  The lesson becomes evident."

(if: $Slave is true)[Her hand glides along your masked cheek.](else:)[Her hand glides along your cheek, then carefully unbuckles and pulls forth your gag.  You feel a line of drool dripping down your chin.]

"Speak it."

[["T-This is... our s-shared... f-femininity..."->NunSens11C]]


:: NunSens11A
You orgasm moments after the answer, shivering in your bindings from the experience.  The woman before you gently strokes your head.

"A good start, but go *deeper*."  She may not have meant it as a command, but your body would obey most anything at that moment.  Your hips shift, pressing the device deeper into your cunt.

[["Perception can be... c-can be shared..."->NunSens11B]]
[["T-This is... our s-shared... f-femininity..."->NunSens11C]]


:: NunSens11B
"Indeed..." the owner of the voice, Sister Euphoria purrs.  "A *shared* sensation can be so much more powerful then one experienced alone.  Something to remember."

She pauses momentarily, perhaps watching you squirm, before continuing.  "What I will do next will feel cruel-- I am going to remove your sybian."

At first you balk, as if stopping the vibrations between your legs could ever be cruel.  Yet when she follows through, sliding the device back out, you're left with something unexpected-- a static sense of *emptiness*.  Had you ever truly existed without the device?

[["P-Put it back, g-give me more..."->NunSens12Refuse]]
[["T-Thank you..."->NunSens12]]


:: NunSens11C
"Indeed..."  the owner of the voice, Sister Euphoria purrs.  "On Torei, a woman can lead a thousand different lives.  Be a freewomb, a slave.  A concubine, and heirmaker.  But that does not change our basic femininity.  Our shared weakness, our sensuality..."

Sister Euphoria's voice is empathetic, but firm.  "No.  Your lesson has concluded, and your body is overwhelmed.  In the face of such sensations, it lies.  You need time to recover."

(if: $Slave is true)[Her hand slips between your legs, pressing gently against your sealed cunt.  You nearly cum again.  "Plugs are a blessing, and a terrible burden.  You must be strong, Sister."](else:)[Her hand slips between your legs, pressing gently against the lips of cunt.  You're wet, dripping on the floor.  "I know, I know," she cooes.  "But it must be done.]

[[You moan quietly.->NunSens12]]


:: NunSens12
The Sister remains with you as you slide back down from such peaked ecstasy, returning to someting approaching normalcy despite the orgasmic chorus that still surrounds.  It's hard not to be jealous of them.

(if: $Blue is true)[Eventually she reaches between your legs, and closes your zipper.  Once again your blue laminate is sealed.] (if: $Smoke is true)[Eventually she reaches between your legs, and closes your zipper.  Once again your smokey laminate is sealed, but you're still very much on display.] (if: $Brand is true)[Eventually she reaches between your legs, and closes your zipper.  Once again your branded laminate is sealed, but your corset still embraces so tightly, and your toes ache.] (if: $Sec is true)[Eventually she reaches towards your hips, sliding your skirt back down as much as possible.] (if: $Slave is true)[Eventually she reaches between your legs, running her palm one last time against your sealed cunt before pulling away.]

Unlocking you from the prayer device is quick enough, but it takes some time for your shaking legs to support your weight.  Only then does Euphoria guide you through the darkness, heading back the way you came.

The sounds of *Sensation* grow quieter and quieter, until the they cease altogether.

[[Good riddance...->NunSens13]]
[[You already miss it.->NunSens13]]


:: NunSens13 [Debt]
Eventually she reaches to your side, pulling on something that responds with a mechanical crunch.  Light emerges before you, bright and glaring.  You emerge back out into the shadowed garden.  Compared to the absolute silence of the Convent, the garden seems almost alive with sound and light as you reaccustom yourself to a world beyond darkness.

Euphoria does not ask more of you, but merely returns to her kneeling position at the center of the small clearing.  As her hands fold together, she speaks once more.

"As I promised, there is something like *Bliss* to be found in Sensation.  But I hope you learned something as well.  Either way, I have deposited 50 credits in your account, child."
(set: $debt to it + 50)(set: $NunSens to true)

[["It was... a lesson indeed."->Nun Hub]]
[[Step back and away...->Nun Hub]]


:: NunRev2
"Then we must speak of Sin."

She rises, casting you in further shadow as she stands above you.  It's a position that makes her piercing stare all the more intensive, as if she really could see deep into your soul.  What did she find there?

"We have spoken of Sin during the path of Contemplation, although indirectly.  What do you recall of it?"

[["Regarding my... memory?"->NunRev3]]
[["I'm not sure what you mean."->NunRev3]]


:: NunRev3
"We discussed your memories, yes-- and your lack of concrete purpose.  Your struggle between what you perceive to be, and what likely is.  But that is a symptom of your Sin, not the Sin itself.  Remember that Sin is the antithesis of Bliss, the rejection of your natural self.  Recall your experiences, your perception of your role in this world."

[["My sin... are you referring to my lack of... place?  As an offworlder new to this world, or someone very experienced...?"->NunRev4]]
[["My sin... are you referring the Black Card, my confusion regarding my own intent?"->NunRev4]]


:: NunRev4
"Go further," she prompts.

[["The... totality of it.  Everything?  Is that what you mean?  That my Sin is the struggle between what I have perceived, and how readily I respond to it?  The... way my body responds to laminate, to bondage?  That I have felt shame and yet... and yet..."->NunRev5]]


:: NunRev5
Sister Euphoria collects her hands before her carefully, bowing her head in a display of reverent approval.  "...and yet you cannot avoid what you perceive as ultimately desirable.  Come."

She guides you towards the now familiar doors, and the black abyss within.  Once more you are plunged into that eternal solitude, but this time when the Nun takes your shoulders, guiding you, she directs you further back into the Convent.  Far further then you had gone before.  Along the way you sense several other forms that flank you, exchanging whispered words with Euphoria.  Despite your proximity, you catch only the odd syllable.  Clearly they're quite experienced in the quiet of the Convent.

"We are here," Euphoria finally prompts, raising her voice.  You glance around, but the darkness is the same as any other-- beyond your ability to perceive.  "My Sisters will assist us in your assuming the proper position for prayer.  You need not do anything more than endure, and set a proper example for the others.  Is that understood?"

[["The... others?"->NunRev6B]]
[["Yes, Sister."->NunRev6]]


:: NunRev6
Unlike your previous experiences, you are not directed towards the floor.  Instead the myriad of gloved hands that slide across your laminate body direct you to remain standing, stepping forward towards what an errant bump of your leg reveals to be a pole emerging vertically from the floor.

"Child," a new voice instructs, "(if: $Slave is true)[Your plugs will remain in, but we will be positioning this bar between your legs, pressing up against them.  *Hard.*"](else:)[There is a pole before you, atop which is a phallic device.  We will be installing you upon it."]

You're not given the opportunity to resist, not this far in.  Instead several sets of hands merely guide you forward, making good on their promise.  In short order the pole is placed, then risen-- pressing up between your legs.  When they add chains to cuffs at your ankles, enforcing a wide stance, you quickly find yourself unable to pull free of the pole.  You simply lack the slack to lift your torso off the device.  It's a prison of sorts, deviously simple.

Other restraints follow. (if: $Slave is true)[Already masked, they install some manner of additional filter over your oxygen intake-- making your already difficult breathing a continuous labor, your lungs screaming from the effort.](else:)[A gag much like the muzzle-like device Euphoria wore is installed, although with the addition of a laminate intruder entering your mouth as other components cover your lips and chin, encapsulating and gripping your entire jaw in slick laminate.]  (if: $Level is 0 or 1)[Your arms are next, forced behind you in an excruciating manner, palms coming together at the small of your back-- a reverse prayer, where they are secured.  The angle naturally forces your head down, the pain that comes with trying to raise it impossible to overcome for more then a few moments.](if: $Level is > 1)[Your armbinder is linked to some manner of descending chain, forcing it up in a way that requires your head to remain bowed-- the pain that comes with trying to raise it impossible to ovecome for more then a few moments.] 

(if: $Slave is true)[[[You shift your hips, the pole between your legs shifting your plugs in a truly frustrating fashion.->NunRev7]]](else:)[[["Mmmgh..."->NunRev7]]]


:: NunRev7
One last bit of preparation comes in the form of a hard, rounded object being pressed against your womanhood-- just before and above the pole, against your clit.  You have enough experience by now to realize what it was before one of the Sisters clicks it on, but hearty hum that rises confirms it regardless-- a vibrating wand, undoubtedly held against your immobile form by an extended boom arm.

And it feels *good*.  (if: $Slave is true)[By rolling your hips forward you can induce a stronger buzz against your front plug, but it's a hard position to hold, your corset interfering.  Neither does your mask, the additional restrictions placed upon your breathing already leaving you to pant-- after a few moments you're almost hyperventilating, trying desperately to seek out the pleasure even as you all but suffocate.](else:)[By rolling your hips forward you can place the vibrator directly against the cock buried deep between your legs, inducing an immediate purr that runs up your entire spine.  Had your restraints not held you up you're liable to have collapsed right there, your panting indicative of a pleasure that almost immediately pushed your body to the limit.]

Euphoria's voice remains near, her soothing touch on your hip, your thigh.  "Peace, (if: $Slave is true)[Sister](else:)[child].  You have yet to even truly begin your Revelation.  Are you ready?"

That hand on your body slips further down, circling the vibrating wand's tip, tickling the laminate and flesh beneath already so primed by your intruder and the vibrations upon it.

"Beg for it."

(if: $Slave is true)[[[P-P-Please... S-Sister...->NunRev8YES]]](else:)[[["Mmmgh... Pplhggh!"->NunRev8YES]]]

She does not elaborate further.

[["Great."->NunRev6]]


:: NunRev8YES
Your prayers are answered by blinding light.

The darkness of the Convent is *broken* by light bright enough to force your eyes close, tears emerging from the sudden pain that follows.  Afterward you blink, bleary eyes trying desperately to adjust to your changed circumstances.  It's not an easy transition.

The light focuses, becoming less all-encompassing until you can at least determine it had a source-- the wall before you, previously black as anything else, had change.  It is now a rectangular portal, perhaps six meters wide by two meters tall.  And there are *things* moving past it.  People.

It is not a portal to some other world, but a *window*, having made transparent what had once been opaque.  A window looking out onto what could only be the street behind the Convent, much the same as the one you had entered from: an empty street but busy sidewalks, so many in glossy laminate.  Passing by, yes... but suddenly looking at you.

"It's much too late for doubts."  That's not Euphoria, but another voice, off somewhere in the darkness to your left.

"Give her a moment."

They don't have to wait long.  Without your eyes to see, your other senses are stronger-- or at the very least more focused.  And nothing overawes like the steady burn between your legs, a sensation you are incapable of escaping.  To your credit, you do try, pulling hard against the prayer frame, trying to free your arms.  When they fails you attempt at least to raise your eyes, to seek out something besides what could only be the humility of the floor below.

But you can't.  You can't pull your arms free, you cannot rise your head, and you *cannot* deny the fire between your legs.

When Euphoria speaks again, you struggle to determine just how much time had passed.  Seconds?  Minutes?  More?

**"Beg for it."**

And you do.

Your restraints prevent much movement, but your eyes can make up some of the difference as you try to look to your left.  The window to the world beyond does not go forever, but the darkness of the Convent is intensive-- where the shadow returns you can make out few details.  Only that would stood in the halo of light created by the window itself is apparent, and it's here that you notice several other Sisters of the Order of the Primrose.  Like Euphoria they wear uniforms of black and color, but the latter components do vary-- one is red as you expect, but two others are white.  They each have deep, saturated eye colors to match their uniforms, but their the differences end-- and indeed its their similarity that is most stark.  So dressed they are difficult to otherwise tell apart, and their proportions are all but identical.  

Hands clasped before their full chests, palms together, they appear to be praying.

[[You moan quietly.->RevNuns2]]


:: RevEuphoria
You fight your restraints, and manage--barely-- to look to your right.  There a solitary figure stands, her uniform indistinct, but you've talked to her enough to recognize Euphoria regardless.  Her hood still pastes a shadow across her eyes, but you can see those red pupils looking out, observing those who pass by.

It's a scene that passes quickly, the Sister's head dipping slightly as she reaches down and flairs her cloak, spreading her legs.  (if: $PlayE is true)[You recognize the Torean *reverence*.]  Glancing back to the window, you see a male in a sharply cut laminate suit observing your situation.  He smiles, then passes before the window and disappears on the far side.
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
[[The Sisters truly respect masculinity.->RevHub]]


:: RevSign
You look into the reflection, into yourself.  (if: $Blue is true)[The blue of your laminate still gleams, the heavy cuffs you wore integrated into the prayer frame.  With your zipper open hints of flesh are visible between your legs, but the thick cock of the pole impaled within you blocks much, along with the strategically placed vibrator.] (if: $Smoke is true)[The smokey coloration of your laminate still gleams, the harness pulled tightly across your upper torso having been integrated into the prayer frame.  With your zipper open hints of flesh are visible between your legs, but the thick cock of the pole impaled within you blocks much, along with the strategically placed vibrator.] (if: $Brand is true)[The black of your branded laminate still gleams, the various adverts and slogans painted across your curvaceous form still so bright in comparison.  You wriggle, your breasts pushed out by the combined work of the frame and your own corset, the latter having grown somewhat more comfortable the more you wore it.  With your zipper open hints of flesh are visible between your legs, but the thick cock of the pole impaled within you blocks much, along with the strategically placed vibrator.] (if: $Sec is true)[The white and red of your professionally attired laminate still gleams, but it's devilishly hard to *blend in* with the similarly dressed outside when forced into such a position of enforced prayer.  Your skirt hides your womanhood, but the pole running up between your legs could only be interfacing in one manner-- and few can ignore the allure of the vibrator pressed against the taut laminate before you.  To your shame, you return the favor, thrusting your hips forward in search of the heady vibrations.] (if: $Slave is true)[The pure black of your slave suit still gleams, the standardized design a testament to your submission.  You wriggle, your breasts pushed out by the combined work of the frame and your own corset, the latter having grown somewhat more comfortable the more you wore it.  The zipper between your legs is still sealed, but that only ensures the plugs installed there remain buried, your hips pressing whoreishly forward, seeking the vibrator.]
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
But that is not all you notice-- for in the reflection you see something you would not otherwise have noticed.  Behind you hangs a sign, the Torean lettering upon it difficult to read backwards, but you parse it out slowly:

*This Sinner offers her penance to this community.  

She is a whore, who sought out the vibrator between her legs.  
She is a slut, who revels in the bondage enforced upon her.
She is feminine, submissive by nature.*

[[And now everyone knows.->RevHub]]


:: RevStrug
You struggle, as best you can.  The Order of the Primrose may be a religious organization, but they *are* Torean.  Their bondage work and gear leaves you little liberty, and straining against the various cuffs and chains quickly tires you.  

Perhaps more importantly, you provide quite a show for those watching from the world beyond the window.  Every time you shift your shoulders your chest is emphasized, while further down your hips have a mind of their own, seeking out further pleasure from the vibrator despite your best intentions.
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
The more you struggle, the more pole and vibrator collude to leave you panting, your muscles tensing as they seek release.  A vicious cycle.

[[You slump back in your bondage.->RevHub]]


:: RevPray
Were you a religious person, before Torei?  You don't *think* so.  But recalling things had never been your specialty.  You do not remember any prayers, however.  The solace of mythology and metaphysics are denied you.

To your sides, however, you do occasionally pick up the murmuring of those Sisters who flanked you.  They *did* have prayers, and being so intrinsically Torean they could even have applied to this situation.  But those are not available to you, not *yet*.  As Euphoria had said upon your first meeting, many are called to the Convent.  Few truly understand *why.*
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)
[[Perhaps you do now.  Or... not.->RevHub]]


:: RevMoan
It's such a simple thing, to let it out.  Catharsis.  Your (if: $Slave is true)[masked moans, your gasping attempts at breath...](else:)[gagged moans, your mewling attempts at that which is denied you now.  *Speech.*]

Nothing much is accomplished, however.
(set: $TransportCheck to it + 1)

[["Mmmggh..."->RevHub]]


:: RevCum
It feels so *good*.  

The first time.

Afterward, the Sisters make no effort to release you.  Your bindings remain in place, the phallic intruder between your legs as well.  And the vibrator seems to only run faster.  Nature runs its course.  You cum again, then again.  And again, and again, and again...

By perhaps the first half dozen you couldn't have raised your head if your prayer frame had allowed you, but instead merely drool lewdly onto the floor, chest rising and falling rapidly as you inhale violently-- your body trying to regulate itself.  It *fails*.

Even further in, the window seems to dim.  The world outside loses its luster, growing darker.  The pleasure between your legs remains intense, inescapable, but exhausted muscles ache as well.  You're spent, and yet your Revelation pushes on.  Endlessly.  Perhaps you even hallucinate, towards the end.  Glancing up, somewhere deep into this waking hell, you see a demon passing outside.  Black of suit, black of mask... so... *familiar*...

[[And then you pass out.->NunRevEnd]]


:: RevNuns2
They do not respond.

But one does effectually step back into the darkness, shadows gliding across her uniform before she disappears.  One of those in white and black.  She reappears a few minutes later, carrying something as she approaches you.

Standing before you, the angle your prayer frame required allows you only to look at a downward angle-- meeting the tall woman's heavy corset with your gaze.  But it's her hands you focus upon anyway.  In one she has a small vial of some manner of clear solution, and in the other small cloth.  Applying the first to the latter, she reaches out-- and begins shining your laminate.

You vaguely recall guarantees that laminate retained its gloss and luster for weeks at a time, but the Sister before you doesn't appear to mind.  She works slowly, moving in small circles starting at the collar around your neck.  From there she shifts downward, to your shoulders, then your breasts.  (if: $Level is > 2)[Your pierced nipples get special attention, the Sister passing several times over the laminate of your chest to ensure the alterations are evident.]  (if: $Slave is true or $Brand is true)[Your corset is next, the tight curve from bust to waist given a fresh coat of shine.]  Then your hips and legs, moving down to your shoes so far below.

By the time she returns to your left, you positively shine in the light of the window.

(if: $Slave is true)[[[You shift your hips, pressing your ass plug deeper inside.  It's more a reflex then a purposeful decision.->RevHub]]](else:)[[["Mmmmmm..."->RevHub]]]


:: RevWin
Torei looms beyond the window, and so many eyes are upon you.  How could they not be?  You are on display for them, bound and humbled, wriggling in bondage as your cunt is teased.  This is *your* Revelation.  The pleasure between your legs, your ability to endure... perhaps you *are* more experienced with this then you know.  And if not?  You must be a natural.

One passing slave pauses and opens her mouth, the glass soundproof but her amusement clear.  The woman accompanying her, perhaps her owner, swats her quickly on the rear as they continue on.  Another woman makes some sort of hand signal towards you, her eyes empathetic.  Others merely ignore your humiliation, but that's almost worse, isn't it?  To be displayed so publically, and to *still* be unworthy of attention?

(if: $IsabellaCheck is true)[A familiar face even passes, her pure black outfit and bright red lips a signature all their own.  You can almost smell the cinnamon of her cigarette.  Isabella, the Mistress from the bench you met before.  She looks behind you and frowns, continuing on her way.]

:: NunRevEnd [Debt]
You awaken in another world.  Black and white, the abyss of the Convent and the world outside, is replaced by smooth shades of violent trendings blue.  Silence prevails, unbroken by a desperate hum between your legs.  You rouse, and find yourself in the garden outside, the *Silent Escorts* shifting quietly in the breeze that does not reach your pool of tranquil afterglow.

Above you, red eyes eclipse your vision.  Sister Euphoria, looking down at you.  She's kneeling, your head resting on her thighs.
(set: $debt to it + 100)
"What was your Revelation?"
(set: $NunPath to true)
[["100 credits earned through hell."->NunRevDeny]]
[["That Torei is... a place like none other."->NunRevDeny]]
[["That... I came here for the wrong reasons.  I seek not credits, but Conversion..."->NunRevAcc]]


:: NunRevDeny
The Nun smiles, her lips just barely visible as they move beneath the laminate of her muzzle.

"There is no shame in exploration.  We do not always find that which we seek, but knowing which paths to avoid in the future is almost as important."

Gently she guides you back to your feet before retaking her customary kneeling position at the center of the small clearing.  Her eyes close as gloved palms come together.

"Torei awaits you, Seeker.  The Order has donated 100 credits to your account, and you are free to again walk your own path."

[[You step back and away...->Nun Hub]]


:: NunRevAcc
The Sister peers down at you, those unnatural eyes burning beneath her shadowed veil.

"I have perceived much the same.  But this is not a path one walks lightly, without due consideration.  I would advise that you see what other paths are available to you.  Walk some of them."

Gently she guides you back to your feet, her cloak glistening as readily as your own laminate.  "And if you truly seek Conversion, return to me later."

She retakes her customary kneeling position at the center of the small clearing.  Her eyes close as gloved palms come together.  "Torei awaits you, Seeker.  The Order has donated 100 credits to your account, as we promised."

[[You step back and away...->Nun Hub]]


:: Pickup2
Euphoria looks towards the way you came, beyond the gate and to the world beyond.  In the tranquil quiet of the Convent's garden, it's easy to forget how close it was.

"When we Sisters seek Confirmation in our Order, we undertake several vows.  One of these prohibits us from traveling beyond the grounds of our Convents and Missions without a proper escort-- be they an Elder Sister, any male, or a freewomb such as yourself.  Myself and the other Elders are occupied, but we would like to get Sister Dahlia started on her training regimen today if possible.  She has only recently entered service as a novitiate."
(set: $NunPick to true)
The Sister looks to you.  "The Lead is also an acceptable means of escort, and that is how she arrived here.  Most probably she is waiting for retrieval in the slave pens, at the rear of the raised transport platform."

[["Sister Dahlia, bring her back here.  Got it."->Pickup3]]
[["Before I go, what exactly does she look like?"->Pickup3B]]


:: Pickup3
"Wonderful," the Sister replies, returning to her kneeling position.  "Simply return here with you, and your reward will be granted."

As you move to leave, Euphoria provides an addendum.  "Do make sure she does not get into any trouble.

[["Of course."->Nun Hub]]


:: Pickup3B
"A good question. I have never met Sister Dahlia myself, but the nature of our Order makes certaine expectations obvious." Euphoria replies.  "She is neither an Elder nor a Superior Sister, so her uniform will feature a secondary color of white instead of red as mine is.  She is not yet Confirmed, so she has not taken the Vow of Uniformity-- expect someone shorter, a more variable build.  She would have a habit instead of a full cloak, and... ah!  The Vow of Perception, of course-- she would not of undergone that either.  So her eye color will be whatever she entered the Order with."

The much taller Sister looks to you. "The uniform alone will make her stick out, of course.  We are noted whenever we travel."

[["Sister Dahlia, shorter then you, white and black uniform.  Got it."->Pickup3]]


:: TransPickup
The loading platforms and their attendant lines take up the majority of the raised area, but you maneuver around them, making instead for a sign labeled *Slave Pickup*.  Thankfully the queue for this is much quicker, and it's not long before you're faced with a smiling Transit Attendant in a glossy blue uniform.

"Name of the slave you wish to pickup, Ma'am?"

Her hands hover over her keyboard, expectantly.

(if: $NunPaidFine is true)[[["Sister Dahlia.  She had a fine associated with her but that should now be cleared?"->TransPickTRUANT]]](else:)[[["Sister Dahlia."->TransPick2]]]

"One moment," the stewardess responds.  It quite literally takes her only the one.  "Ah, I see.  Sister Dahlia of the Order of the Primrose, registered slave.  Arrived via the Lead this morning.  Held for escort.  I imagine that would be you?"

She smiles at the rhetorical question, but her blue lips twitch downward as she reads further.  "Ah, ma'am, before I can release your slave there is something we must address.  It appears she has an outstanding Truancy violation, and a pending fine of 50 credits."

[["What did she do?"->TransPick3]]


:: TransPick3
The Transit girl shrugs her shoulders, the movement emphasizing the heavy collar around her throat.  "The Ministry of Truants does not allow us such information, they only require us to hold the slave in question until the fine has been paid-- or a Truant Officer has waived the requirement.  Would you like to address the fine right now?"

You certainly could, but that would be coming out of your own pocket.  (if: $TruantFound is false)[A small fine on a member of a religious order could probably be waived, if you could find a Truant Officer.](if: $TruantFound is true)[A small fine on a member of a religious order could probably be waived, if you speak to a Truant Officer-- like the one that nearly arrested you at that checkpoint.]

She feeds the monetary device into the terminal before then, then returns it. "There we are, 50 credits have been deducted, and your slave's hold order has been revoked.  Please take a seat while we retrieve her from storage.

She indicates a set of chairs nearby.

[[Take a seat.->MeetDahlia]]

(set: $NunHave to true)
In a quick flurry of typing, she pulls up the relevant data on her terminal. "I see, the hold order has indeed been revoked by Ministry authority.  Excellent.  Please take a seat while we retrieve your slave from storage."

She indicates a set of chairs nearby.

[[Take a seat.->MeetDahlia]]

The Officer's eyes narrow.  "No.  Not before we discuss that job I will be using you for.  After we do that... *maybe.*"

She makes it seem unlikely regardless.

[["...okay."->Truant Hub]]


:: TruantQuestExplain
Nikaido rises from her leaning position against her car, very much *not* looking like you had just offered to potentially help her.

"Finally," she growls, grabbing you roughly by the (if: $Slave is true or $Blue is true)[collar](else:)[throat], shoving you up against the vehicle she had just left.  "Listen well then, because I'm only going to say this once.  And to make *sure* you're listening, I'm going to start with what you offworlders always like.  Credits.  You do what I tell you, and I'll give you 400 credits.  Hell, I'll throw in a Freewomb train pass as well.  This needs to get done."

She looks to you, imperious and demanding.  "*Are* you listening?"

[["400 credits?  Wow.  Yeah."->TruantExplain 2]]
[["Yes, Officer."->TruantExplain 2]]


:: AskTruantMin
"No."

The laconic answer is stark, hard.

"The Ministry has PR slaves for that.  Just know we reward helpful freewombs, and we punish unhelpful ones.  Which are you?"

[[Helpful... right?->Truant Hub]]


:: TruantExplain 2
"Good."  She releases her grasp on you somewhat, but a quick glance around allows you to observe others passing by avoiding the Truant Officer's immediate presence.  Nikaido hardly seems to mind as she continues.

"The checkpoint you passed through earlier was an attempt to find a fugitive slave."  You get the sense the Officer is always this straightforward and direct.  "One we *know* is in this area, trying to leave via the transport hub.  She is owned by a particularly well-connected Master, and he is very much up my station's ass to track her down before she leaves this area and becomes harder to find.  What we need from you is only a location.  Find where she is, report that to me.  And I'll pay you 400 credits and that pass.  Simple."

[["I have some questions."->TruantExplainHub]]

"Ask your questions," the Officer growls, begrudgingly.  It's obvious she's not used to doing anything but directing a conversation.

(if: $TruantQuest is true)[[["That's all the questions I have for now."->TruantQuestHub]]]


:: TruantWhy
"Because of what you are," she replies, as if the answer was obvious.  "An offworlder, a freewomb, new to this area.  No one would expect you to be working for the Ministry of Truants, and they're more likely to allow you to ask questions.  Even *dumb* questions, like this one."

[["I see."->TruantExplainHub]]


:: TruantWho
"Ellia Amadori," the Officer replies, working without a need to check her notes.  Either she had a good memory, or her superiors really *were* riding her hard to find this woman.  "Offworlder.  Native to Arias IV.  Twenty-three years old, arrived on-planet at age eighteen.  Enslaved at age nineteen.  We doubt she will have any identification card on her, however.  Thus our checkpoints.  Heavy-handed, but we're running out of time.  Once a slave moves beyond their immediate surroundings they get difficult to track, despite our various methods.  Should have been chipped."

Nikaido shrugs her shoulders, as if to acknowledge that was too late now.

[["Ellia Amadori, got it."->TruantExplainHub]]


:: TruantWhat
"She's a runaway."  Nikaido seems to spit out that last word, with clear vehemence.  "Slipped out of her Master's compound six days ago."

[[You nod, unwilling to fan her anger further.->TruantExplainHub]]


:: TruantDesc
Again, the Officer does not need to refer to anything beyond her own memories to answer the question.  "5'7, slender.  Red hair, but shaved.  Expect her to be wearing a hood of some sort to obscure that.  Green eyes.  Has been a patient at the Ministry of Improvement several times, but that's not generally something you can tell visually.  Pierced tongue, but that could have been removed.  Tattooed with her Master's initials, LV, on her neck."

[[A tattoo and rare hair color, that could help.->TruantExplainHub]]


:: TruantExplain 3
The Truant Officer gestures towards the crowded streets around you.  "She is somewhere near here, we know that.  *Close.*  We suspect she is attempting to acquire transportation-- the Transport Hub should probably be your first stop.  After that?  You will need to figure that out for yourself.  We do know the Liberty Society has a local chapter near here, but their representative has been hostile when we attempt to question him.  But perhaps others will know?  That's for you to find out."

"Shit, almost forgot," she reaches towards her belt, among the various whips, cuffs, and stun batons hanging there.  From somewhere among them she pulls forth a small remote, handing it to you.

"The tattoo of her Master's initials, LV, will probably be your best means of determining the slave's identity.  But you could try that remote as well, it's wirelessly synched to her rainbow implants if you get close enough."

[["Rainbow implants?"->TruantAskRainbow]]
[["Find the runaway, tell you where she is.  Got it."->TruantExplain4]]


:: TruantAskRainbow
"Right," the Officer grimaces, a hand pressed against her forehead.  "Forgot I'm dealing with another offworlder.  Rainbow implants-- they're a Torean standard many slaves have them.  At the erogenous hot spots.  Nipples, clit, tongue.  They can stimulate, shock, depends on the particular design.  The name comes from the glow some give when operating, colors indicating various effects."

She reaches out, tapping the small remote.  "For your purposes, just hit the stim or shock function-- well, probably *shock*.  Damn slave deserves it.  Anyway, you should see an immediate reaction if you're close enough.  Another way to identify."

[["Find the runaway.  Got it."->TruantExplain4]]


:: TruantExplain4
The Truant Officer reaches up, adjusting her cap slightly.  "Good.  Even an offworlder should be able to handle this.  Find the slave, report her position back to me.  You get 400 credits and a train pass, and I get some far too rich Master off my ass."
(set: $TruantQuest to true)
She crosses her arms across her chest, leaning back against her patrol car again.  What comes next is only given grudgingly.  "Now that you know what you need to do, you better get to it.  But if you need anything else from me... I suppose you can ask them now.  Don't make me regret it."

[[Ellia Amadori, the investigation begins.->Truant Hub]]

Truant Officer Nikaido's eyes narrow, matching the frown that forms across her painted lips.  It's an expression she holds for a considerable amount of time, long enough you just know she's going to refuse you.  

But she doesn't.

"Only because you're helping me.  A Sister of the Convent nearby, you mean?  Give me her name."  Reaching in through her vehicle's open window, she pulls forth a datapad linked to the car's onboard systems by a curled cord.

[["Sister Dahlia, she just arrived at the transport hub this morning."->TruantNun2]]

The Officer types quickly, a response from her query coming in the space of a few moments.  "Sister... Dahlia, right?  Slave of the Order of the Primrose.  Yeah, I'm seeing the 50 credit fine and hold order on here.  Looks like its for... nothing major.  A curfew violation."

She looks to you, finger poised over the datapad.  "I can clear it easily enough, but you're going to have to ask more formally then you just did.  In the Torean manner.  Do you know what that means?"

"Offworlders," the Officer scoffs.  "Alright, you're going to need to find someone else if you want all the intricacies of it.  But a proper reverence, that's what you do when you're meeting with or requesting something from a superior.  Like *myself.*"

She flicks two fingers your way.  "Spread your legs.  If you're wearing a skirt and have your hands free, you lift the skirt.  Only a catsuit?  Open your zipper.  Goal is to display your cunt for a few moments, demonstrate your submission and respect.  If you're tied up tight (if: $Level is > 1)[like you are with that binder,] you just spread your legs and press your hips forward."

Those two fingers now point downward, swirling.  "Show me, and ask nicely."

You're not waiting long before another employee of the transport hub emerges from a side door, towing behind her a woman of laminate and faith.

Sister Dahlia is much as you were led to expect, with a uniform bearing many similarities to Euphoria's.  The greatest difference is the color change, the reds of the older woman replaced on Dahlia by pure white.  Instead of a long cloak her habit is short, passing just behind her shoulders and exposing more readily the cuffs she bears on her wrists.  Similar devices are locked to her ankles, and yet another is pulled tight around her throat.  It's that last one a simple black laminate leash is connected to, and that you are give.

The Sister's muzzle makes it impossible to tell if she is gagged, at least until she demonstrates she was not-- but greeting you enthusiastically.

"Oh!  You must be the escort the Convent arranged?  I'm Sister Dahlia... but I suppose you already know that, huh?  Neat!  You're going to be taking me to the Convent, right?"

It's a bit difficult to match the girl's outgoing personality with the stark religiousness of her uniform.

[["Yes, I'm your escort to the Convent."->Dahlia2]]

"Great!" The Sister responds, as you lead her away from the Slave Pen desk.  She follows readily, arms held before her due to the chain linking her wrists together.  

Once you've gotten a bit of distance from anyone else, the Nun speaks again.

"You uh... you paid the fine I had, right?"

:: DahliaMin2
"You *can't!*" She speaks a bit too loud, drawing several brief glances from those nearby.  Dahlia glances about, her habit shifting along her shoulders, before looking back to you.  "I mean... could you make sure you don't?  I swear I didn't do it, what they fined me for.  Curfew violation.  At least not on purpose.   I'm just still getting used to it.  The Order, I mean, and what... uh, that means.  The rules the Sisters have, and the other ones that apply to me now.  For being a slave."

Her collar glints in the light.

[["Why does it matter what I tell Euphoria?"->Dahlia3]]


:: Dahlia3
Dahlia's response is immediate.  "Because if you tell her about the fine, she will know I did something wrong.  I want to make a good first impression!"

She rolls her shoulders, clearly still adapting to her uniform.  That heavy corset in particular doesn't look altogether comfortable.

"...and because I don't want to be punished for it. You don't know what its like to spend hours and hours performing enforced prayer!  And that's *before* they make me perform flagellation, or put me in silence for however long they want!"

"Thank you, thank you, thank you-- yes, think about it!  That's all I'm asking!"

It's a request she makes just as you turn a corner, the secluded gate of the Convent coming into view.

[[Enter the garden.->Dahlia5]]

The Sister only sighs in response, perhaps resigned to her fate.  It's well timed as you round a corner, the secluded gate of the Convent coming into view.

As had become customary, you find Sister Euphoria kneeling amongst the strange foliage, hands together in silent prayer.  She rises at your approach, standing so much taller then the Sister she greets.

"Ah, Sister Dahlia!  You have arrived, in no small part thanks to the assistance of our helpful traveler."

She snaps her gloved fingers.  "Supplication."

It's a command Dahlia obviously knows, as she moves to her knees, bowing her head as her legs spread.  Her linked wrists frame her chest as she plants her palms on the ground, and Euphoria proceeds to ignore her for the time being.

"A simple deed done well, the Convent thanks you."  Her hands find your shoulders, less an embrace then a compassionate show of true appreciation.  "Were there any problems?"

[["Well, sorry."->Dahlia Hub]]


:: DahliaOff
"Yep," Dahlia replies, looking up, past you.  The foliage around you hides the sky, but its not hard to imagine it up there, and the stars of the greater galaxy beyond.  "Born and raised on an aerostat drifter.  Came down the Way Up... hmm, maybe a year ago?  Thought I was going to see what all the fuss was about."

She glances down to her laminate uniform, and heavy restraints.  "Guess I found the fuss, huh?"

[["Sure looks like it."->DahliaQ]]


:: DahliaJoin
It's a question the Nun not only seems ready for, but embraces.  For the first time, her tone actually turns fervent.  "Because the Order is *Torean.*  The galaxy is huge, and ancient, and... shades of the same grey.  You've seen one colony mining world, you've seen them all.  New worlds are found every year, but different sorts of rocks and weather and gravity aren't exciting.  But Torei?  This is something no offworlder could have experienced just a few years ago, traditions and practices... human **stuff** that's radically different."

She tilts her head, an inqusitive gesture that shifts her habit slightly.  "What about you?  Would you join, if you could?"

[["No..."->DahliaJoinNo]]
[["Absolutely not!"->DahliaJoinNo]]
[["...maybe."->DahliaJoinYes]]

"Sister Euphoria says being a member of the Order is a path, not a singular state of mind," Dahlia says, very seriously-- for all of two moments, before she laughs quietly.

"Yeah, yeah-- I know.  The others, my Sisters, they say that will change over time.  All the training and prayer we do, you know?  And if I get Confirmed, they *change* you.  Make you taller, same proportions as everyone else... wonder how that will be."

[[She sounds intrigued.->DahliaQ]]


:: DahliaJoinNo
The Nun merely nods.  "It's certainly not for everyone."

[[Indeed.->DahliaQ]]


:: DahliaJoinYes
You catch glimpses of a wide smile beneath her muzzle.  "Full warning, that would put you in a uniform identical to mine.  And, you know, everything *else* that entails."

Dahlia shrugs.  "I sort of *like* being made to wear this, though, so... you should really talk to Euphoria, I guess.  If you haven't already.  You don't have any *idea* what you would be getting into..."

She nearly stands, only to look around you at her Sister still nearing in the clearing.  Presumably Euphoria would not be pleased, so Dahlia sates herself with a knowing wink.

"A warning," she repeats, leaning in, towering above you.  Her red eyes look deep into your own, searching.  "A dire warning." 

She reaches up, pulling down the laminate muzzle that encapsulated her chin and mouth.  For the first time her lips are revealed, full and inviting, painted a deep glossy black.  And across them, one white word upon each, carefully inscribed in the Torean script:

**Slave
Sinner**

"I believe you capable of entering service within the Order."  She continues, as you fail to avoid the truth that her convictions are faulty, mortal, born from the mouth of a sinner and slave.  "It would be a furthering of what I observed as you walked the paths of Contemplation, Sensation, and Revelation.  Regardless, I must recommend against this path.  To enter the Order is to forego much in this life.  Wealth.  Comfort.  Liberty.  You will be held to a standard of conduct far above most others, and your Sins carefully recorded.  You will be judged, and found wanting.  As we all are.  But thus is the path towards Bliss, and how we walk it.  Being corrected and trained, punished and denied, every step of the way."

[["What of... my goals before?  My deal, the Black Card?"->NunRevBlack]]
[["This is the path I wish to walk."->NunRevFinal4]]
[["I must... I must reconsider...->Nun Hub]]


:: NunRevFinal4
"So be it." (if: $Blue is true or $Smoke is true or $Brand is true or $Sec is true)[Euphoria leans in suddenly, her branded lips finding your own.  The meeting is electric, her tongue entering your mouth, your bodies momentarily one.  The kiss of a sinner, a slave, and soon to be your Sister.] 

Then she retreats, pulling her muzzle back up as she guides you towards the door to the Convent. (if: $NunEnd1 is true or $NunEnd2 is true)[Dahlia is summoned to trail along as well.]  Entering the black, she guides you as she had thrice previously.  As with Revelation you are directed back, deep into the heart of the abyss.  But instead of the windowed room, you sense a different chamber having been entered-- moments before you see it, lights flickering on in the darkness.  Red neon in the form of a triangle, the Order's symbol, frames a raised platform upon which you are directed to stand.  

Despite the light, gloom still prevails, revealing little more then the dark stone ceiling-- and figures moving above.  Only Euphoria remains at your side, occasionally watching the progress with eyes that *pierced* the black.

"You will be entering service as a Novitiate, by Torean law a slave for three months.  At the end of that period you may renew your vows, or leave.  That is your choice.  If you renew four times, the fourth will be your Confirmation-- where you become a full member of our Order.  That is when the Vow of Uniformity is enforced upon you, and you are made to look exactly as I do."

Several other members of the Order have taken up positions surrounding you.  Their laminate glows red, reflecting the dim neon lights as Sister Euphoria continues.

"You will take five vows.  Poverty.  Obedience.  Penance.  Femininity.  And Devotion.  Then you will be sanctified, shorn of your current outfit and remade anew in the Order's image.  The next time you leave this chamber, you will be enslaved.  Do you understand?"

[["I do."->NunRevFinal5]]


:: NunRevFinal5
Sister Euphoria nods, then turns to those assembled.  Twelve others now encircle your raised platform, two beside Euphoria wearing black and red, the rest black and white.

"Sisters of the Order of the Primrose, of the Convent of Perception, we have gathered here to enslave another to our faith.  We ask that the supplicant recite the Five Foundational Vows, to take them upon her breast, to bear their weight with grace and humility.  We begin with that of Poverty."

She turns to you, hands held before her.  "Do you accept the Vow of Poverty, to be without wealth or property?  To accept neither coin nor digital clip for your services, to offer yourself freely in accordance with the precepts of the Order?"

[["I do."->NunRevFinal6]]


:: NunRevFinal6
"Do you accept the Vow of Obedience, to learn and obey the strictures placed upon you as a Sister of this Order?  To wear implements of bondage at all times, so that your obedience can be perpetually ensured?  To accept the commands of those deemed superior to you at all times, without hesitation or reservation?"

You lower your gaze to the floor.

[["I do."->NunRevFinal7]]


:: NunRevFinal7
"Do you accept the Vow of Penance?  Do you understand that you are fallible and incapable of perfection, and that when you transgress against the Order, your Sisters, or its strictures that you must actively seek guidance and corrective action?  Do you recognize that in the pursuit of Bliss, you will Sin, and must wear this reminder upon your every word, upon your very lips?"

[["I do."->NunRevFinal8]]


:: NunRevFinal8
"Do you accept the Vow of Femininity?  Do you declare that, by the natural laws of your sex that you are inherently weak of will and body?  Do you recognize the subservience of your gender, and the ascendancy of the Male?  Do you accept that it is your instinctive drive to please others, and to appear pleasing to others in turn?"

[["I do."->NunRevFinal9]]


:: NunRevFinal9

"Great!" Michael responds, clapping you on the back.  "That's just great!  Alright, like I said, you can try approaching anyone you like for individual donations, but you *have* to get to the Transport Platform and our stand there before I'd consider your work complete.  Alright?  Sound good?  Yeah?  Then I'll see you again whenever you finish!"

"Uh... are you sure?" The man asks, looking at you abit quizzically.  "Because you definitely haven't manned our station on the Transport Platform, and you need to do that before you can turn anything in.  I bet that's where the majority of donations are going to come from anyway, it's so busy up there."

Her points to the Platform in the distance.  "So go do that first, like we talked about."

The man smiles, a hand finding your shoulder.  "Hey, great to hear!  How did it go?"

When you explain it was surprisingly uneventful, he simply nods.  "Can't get into much trouble doing work like that, I would think.  If you could stick the clips into my backpack, we can your payment squared away."

He returns briefly to offering his pamphlets to those who pass, leaving you alone along the corner's wall-- where a choice suddenly presents itself.  Michael has not made an effort yet to count the donations, and his back is decidedly turned away from you.  Keeping a few clips for yourself, say... 75 credits worth, seems unlikely to be noticed.

The Torean Mistress tips her head down, looking over her mirrored glasses.  "By Mazos, don't tell me you're associated with those..."

Reaching up, she takes a hard pull on her electronic cigarette.  The red tip glows, so very bright.  As equally crimson smoke escapes her lips, she continues.  "I won't give them a credit."

Last thing we need are Offworlders *really* pouring money into escape routes for slaves.  Legalities become a bitch when they cross borders, you know?"

When I entered the Order, I took a Vow of Poverty.  While I may offer and work with the Convent's funds, it is not permitted for I to have personal possessions of my own, even simple change."

She smiles, beneath her muzzle.  "But I appreciate your intentions, misguided as they may be.  Soliciting others for donations is not a path few walk willingly."

She laughs, leaning further forward until her forehead touches the ground, literally doubling over in laughter.  It takes some time for her to recover, although she makes a quicker effort of it once she notices Sister Euphoria watching from her position across the clearing.

"Okay, okay..." she finally manages.  "I know you're serious, but-- like, the Order is a religious sect, right?  People donate to us, not the other way around.  Just... no, I'm sorry, I won't be donating today."

Whomever dictated the layout of the transport platform had, at least, thought ahead to the prospect of so many travelers moving through it.  A section along the eastern side is reserved exclusively for services pandering to those passing multitudes.  It's among these stall-like enclosures that you find one featuring a large sign for *The Liberty Society*.  That had to be what Michael had indicated.

As promised, the small structure is already stocked with several stacks of pamphlets-- much like those Michael was giving out at his corner post-- alongside a few other broadsheets, each pulled forth from a stack labeled for their intent.  *In Debt?, We Can Help!, and What to do if Your Passport has been Seized* are some of the titles.

Taking up a position behind the counter, you (if: $Level is > 1)[quickly realize this will be somewhat difficult to manage in an armbinder.  Perhaps that will help sell the Society's points, though?](else:)[run your hand across the smooth surface, cleaning off errant bits of dust.]

:: DonateTran2
You've been through a lot since waking this morning.  Laminate and bondage dominate Torei, and in turn had come to dominate you.  Every choice you make seems to pull you just a bit further down, into the morass that Torean culture proved to be for so many offworlders.  And it's that hard-earned experience that makes your next few hours so surprising.  

Everything goes smoothly, for once.  Your luck with promoting the Liberty Society goes about as well as Michael seemed to be fairing, in that few show interest-- but you are able to direct at least a handful of wandering folks towards the Society's hotline.  Donations are rare as well, but you do manage to scrap together a few credit clips.  How many of those are legitimate donations, and how many merely approached to inquire about you in particular is hard to tell.  The glossy (if: $Blue is true)[blue laminate and restraints] (if: $Smoke is true)[semi-transparent laminate and harness] (if: $Brand is true)[black and brand catsuit] (if: $Sec is true)[sheen of your office wear] (if: $Slave is true)[pure black of your slave uniform] did seem to draw attention.

With your words, the power to the triangular lights beneath your stage cut.  Darkness descends as you become one with the void.

"Kneel," a voice from that abyss commands.  Another, different one, follows.

"And be made anew."

[[You kneel.->NunRevFinal11]]

Your transformation proceeds across a timeframe you cannot comprehend.  In that perpetual darkness there is nothing for you to do but kneel, awaiting the fate you have so willingly embraced.  

Torei has claimed another wayward soul.

Hands work across your body, occasionally directing, often simply guiding you into new positions.  You are progressed towards their unseen goal, but certain sensations give hints.  Liquid being poured upon you, sweet yet heady, that seems to evaporate at unnatural speeds-- leaving the flesh that had been warmed by laminate laid bare.  (if: $Level is > 0)[Greater concentrations remove your hobble chain(if: $Level is > 1)[ and armbinder].]  For a shining moment, you are nude.

(if: $Level is < 3)[That exposure is taken advantage of as hands move you to your feet, voices whisperings words of preparation.  Before you can ascertain their intent, sharp pain breaks out across your nipples-- while laminate arms restrain the struggle that only follows most naturally.

The process continues afterward, this time focusing on your nose.  Gloved hands seize your neck, your head, forcing you to look up-- just as pain blossoms from your nose, between the nostrils.  A dozen hypotheses spring forth, but one is confirmed when you are released, head hanging in a way that allows the ring now piercing your septum to shift slightly.  Euphoria bore such adornment, now so do you.

"Amadori?" Euphoria repeats the name, rising to regard you more directly.  "It is vaguely familiar, but I am not sure that I could be of service in this matter.  This Convent may very well be the last place a runaway slave would go, given the nature of our faith."

The collar at her neck, marking her as a slave is gestured to.  "The Order teaches that we, as women, are best suited for service.  But I will still endeavor to provide you with any information that I can."

The Nun nods.  "Sadly, they are quite common throughout Aekora.  The economy of each Ringdom is unique, of course, and Aekora relies primarily on its location-- straddling the space between those Ringdoms abutting the Way Up, and those further afield.  Between them a lucrative slave trade has formed, and the Prime Markets downtown are where the vast majority of this Ringdom's wealth is derived."

Her hands come together, wrist cuffs clicking quietly together.  "And with slave markets, come runaways.  Fortunes can turn quite quickly, if purchased by the wrong Master.  Slavery is an ancient and greatly beneficial practice on Torei, of course, but there are always... rough edges.  Thus the runaways."

[[Euphoria seems genuinely saddened by the prospect.->NunTruantQHub]]


:: NunTruantPamph
The question seems to catch Euphoria by surprise.  "I would have no idea, in truth.  We do advertise our programs in some limited ways, but never to anyone associated with the Liberty Society.  Our faith expressely condones and encourages slavery, after all.  There are very few things with which we would see eye to eye."

She considers the subject further, then leans in, towering over you in the process.  "A suggestion, if you would have it.  Our Convent here is a place of pilgrimage, and on occasion we receive visitors by carriage.  I have come to learn from these interactions that the carriages are expensive, and thus do not ask many questions.  The Lead system requires ID cards, and the local train system a pass for freewombs.  If one were a runaway slave, the carriages may be their best bet at escaping.

The portion of the platform dedicated to the carriages is by far the smallest, but also the least busy.  Those waiting in the handful of seats nearby look universally wealthy.  One woman in particular, dressed in pure black, is attended by a pair of collared girls in bright yellow outfits that provide little in modesty.

(if: $Slave is true)[The carriage attendant, a woman in tight blue laminate, immediately tries to drive you away by asserting quite loudly that carriages were not for slaves.

Like many transporation hubs, the platform has a large area set aside for those waiting for whatever service they intended to engage.  While a few men can be seen, the fast majority are women.  Your instructions, to look for Elizabeth said to be waiting upon a red bench, becomes immediately clear as you survey the area: every thickly padded seat is black, excepting one.  It's bright red finish had to have been what Michael was referring to.

*Two* women are found there, however.  One sits with crossed legs, a datapad held against her knee that she is reading.  Her hair is blonde, and her clothing distinctly un-Torean.  In a sea of laminate, she is wearing regular textiles.  The other woman is black of hair, and cloaked in a simple one piece black laminate dress.  It ends quite high on her thighs.

The blonde blanches, rising suddenly.  "I have no idea what you're talking about, girl.  You must have the wrong person-- I certainly do not associate myself with women who indulge in this horrid planet's customs.  Leave me be."

She promptly marches off, leaving you listing in her wake.  As soon as she is a fair bit away, however, the remain black-haired woman gestures sharply for you to a seat-- nearby, but not facing her.

"That idiot," she curses, momentarily holding a hand to face.  It allows you a chance to observe her closer.  Unlike Michael, who wore the textiles that marked him so obviously as an offworlder, Elizabeth wears laminate as you do.  Her outfit is relatively simply, however, especially by Torean standards.  A one piece dress with long sleeves and a short skirt, knee high stockings all but unadorned, and heeled shoes that trended far more towards *sensible* then full stilleto.

"Shit, shit, shit," she curses, wide-eyed even as she tries to keep her poise given so many potential observers.  "I knew this wouldn't be easy.  If they're employing unaffiliated freewombs... anyone could be an informant."

Elizabeth sighs.  "But if Michael trusts you, we can use you."

[["How?"->TruantQ4]]


:: TruantQ2
"Like hell you are," she responds, forcibly.  A passerby glances your way, and Elizabeth waits for her to move on before continuing.  "Michael wouldn't have sent you to me unless someone sent *you* after Amadori.  Which means the Ministry of Truants is using unaffiliated freewombs in their search.  Shit."

"It's simple, if you're willing to take a risk.  The Liberty Society cannot be caught up in this Amadori situation.  Officially?  We don't touch runaways.  Unofficially?"

She glances to you, offering a slip of laminate.  Taking it reveals the thin sheet to be a ticket stub, ripped in half as if already used to board what the label across the top identifies as the local train system.

"Early this morning we threw the Ministry of Truants off the trail by having someone use the train with Amadori's credentials.  Obviously the Officers found nothing when they searched it before leaving.  If you present the Officer who hired you with that ticket stub, it should convince them Amadori has fled further afield."

[["So the Society does help runaways?"->TruantRunQ]]

"I couldn't tell you that if I wanted to," Elizabeth hisses in response, your question having clearly landed a bit too close to secrets deeply held.  "The way we operate, each safehouse operates independently.  Some don't help runaways, probably most don't.  But some of us aren't content with that, we need to do *something*.  Even if its a drop in the bucket."

Resolve fills her voice.  "This is one of those drops."

The transit employee doesn't even need to check the terminal before you.  "I certainly don't, ma'am.  There is a standing order from the Ministry of Truants on precisely that name, apparently she's a runaway of some sort?  Foolish girl."  The stewardess is collared herself.

[["I'm actually working with the Ministry of Truants.  Did you have any scheduled pickups, perhaps?  Anything out of the ordinary?"->TruantQTrans2]]

This time the woman does turn to her terminal, quickly pulling up several pages of data.  The first bears a logo for the Ministry of Truants. 

"I hope you will excuse the necessity, but I had to check to ensure you were cooperating with an Officer," she explains, dismissing the information as she instead brings up a transit list.  "As you can see, we do fairly brisk work-- right now we have 35 scheduled pickups.  Most of them would be for freewombs fairly well off.  The wealthiest have private carriages, and ours services trend towards being too expensive for anyone else."

Thirty five scheduled pickups is far too many to follow up on.  You have to narrow it down.

[["Do any of the scheduled picks seem out of the ordinary, in any manner?"->TruantQTrans3]]


:: TruantQTrans3
"Hmm..." the attendant hums, running a finger down the list.  She nearly reaches the bottom before stopping.  "Well, this one is interesting.  It doesn't have a name listed for pickup.  Whoever scheduled it paid in cash, and indicated the carriage driver is simply picking up a crate of some sort.  It's scheduled for pickup in two days, with no one accompanying the crate itself.

She looks up.  "I must admit some confusion.  There are much simpler, cheaper ways to transport a mere crate."

And that makes it suspicious.  Two days from now would ensure the carriage itself wouldn't get caught in another checkpoint like you had originally been picked up in.  It's a solid lead.

"Here," the attendant says, giving you a slip of laminate.  "I wrote down the address of the pickup for you.  Quinnette Way, it's not a far walk."

Navigating the streets of Torei is never a simple task.  Between sights so very unique to the planet itself, and the tendency for roads to wander confusingly, its easy to get lost.  But with some perseverance you manage to find the address the Transit employee had given you, on Quinnette Way.

The intended pickup spot for the "crate" turns out to be a simple warehouse, the building clearly kept up, but currently unoccupied.  At least that's what you guess after observing it for a few minutes.  The doors do not open, and no one can be seen entering or leaving.

The door is plastered with a warning sign, indicating trespassers would be reported to the Ministry of Truants.  It's hardly a threat to you given your purpose, and with a nudge of your shoulder the portal opens-- it had not been locked.

Inside reveals the warehouse to look... very much like you would expect a warehouse to look, stacked boxes and crates competing with heaping sacks for space along the floor and shelves.  Dingy lights cast down on the slatted floors you walk along, heels clicking loudly upon the hard surface.

It's not a particularly large warehouse, but searching it top to bottom would take all day.  Looking around, you try to pick out objects of interest.

Following a chainlink fence, you make your way around the back of the quiet building.  A retaining wall marks the end of the property, and its encroachment on the building provides little room to maneuver.  For once, in the history of suspicious warehouses, there is no back door to be found.

[[Front door it is, then.->Quinn2]]


:: QuinnDesk
You approach the plastic desk, a light positioned over it allowing you examine a variety of papers and invoices strewn across it.  

The most prominent is a handwritten missive, a reminder to *lock the door when leaving for lunch.*  Clearly whomever watched over the warehouse had failed regardless of the note.  Other papers note the arrival and departure times of various shipments, a glimpse into the small storage operation obviously occurring here.  Running through the list of upcoming departures, you cross reference it with the Transit employee's scheduled pickup time in two days... only to find the page missing.  The last entry instead notes the upcoming departure of "pre-formed slave uniforms".

(if: $QuinnQ1 is true)[Having found what had turned out to be the missing pages, you again consult the upcoming schedule-- and find exactly what you are looking for.

You manage to kick off the head rather easily, a stiletto heel being jammed into the side proving effective against the simple nails holding it on.  Sliding it off reveals...

Ellia Amadori, neatly packaged for delivery.

She's lying on her stomach, covered from head to toe in black laminate.  Several padded inserts cradle and support her bound form, although given the way her legs are folded back and behind, it hardly looks comfortable.  Her arms are locked together in a heavy armbinder, and she's gagged and hooded-- but the remote had already confirmed it could only be her.

An ingenious plan, really.  The Ministry of Truants was combing the streets and nearby hostels, looking for a slave on the run.  Instead she had been here the entire time, securely stored, incapable of endangering herself or those assisting her-- and ready to be moved as soon as the checkpoints and searches ceased.  It certainly doesn't look like an easy means of escape, but she *was* a slave.  This was a small price to pay for freedom down the line.

Her hood and position prevent her from seeing you, but by the way she squirms clearly she knew she had been discovered.  Amadori is at your mercy.

The bound girl squirms again within her bondage, the piercing in her clit buzzing with sharp pain.  She can neither escape the sensation, nor shift her bindings at all-- it must be terribly maddening.

Box sealed once again, you step away, backtracking away from the wall of crates and then further, out the door and into the street outside.  You have little fear of Amadori wandering in your absence-- she could never escape that bondage, and for the moment you're the only one who knows her exact position.  Now would be the time to return to Truant Officer Nikaido, to report on your findings, and to collect your reward.  It's not too late, however, to instead take Elizabeth's suggestion and protect Amadori.  A simple lie would suffice.
(set: $TruantQFound to true)
[[For now you step away, looking elsewhere for help.->TransitChecktoHub]]


:: QuinnVibe3
The second roll of pleasure through her body is much the same as the first, her bound body straining against industrial-strength restraints.  All she manages is to provide you with a bit of a show, her rear in particular flexing as she tries to shift her hips.

[[Press and hold her vibe.->QuinnVibe4]]
[[Reseal the box.  It's time to talk with Officer Nikaido again.->QuinnEnd]]

The longer taste of vibration against her most sensative nub earns a further gagged squeal, followed by desperate thrashing.  Did she want it to end, or did she merely want more?

You give her the last lick between the legs, pushing her over the top.  Her black laminate body quivers as the ecstasy rolls through.

"Mmmmmph... mmmgh... mmmm...."

Afterward she seems to calm in the afterglow, breathing hard but-- for the briefest moment-- having forgotten her terror at being discovered.

A singular shock, so sudden, so cruel.  Amadori's quivering struggle turns into a violent shake as the pain erupts, a moan emerging as you give her a dose long enough to cure any possibility of orgasm.

Afterward she collapses further into her bondage.  The gag and hood make it difficult to tell, but it sounds like she's crying.

The second shock causes her struggle to turn into a thrash, although the heavy restraints intended to keep her immobile during shipping also do much to limit this.  You can hear her trying to communicate through her gag.  Perhaps begging for you to stop?

The begging turns towards crying as you keep the shock coming, her hips thrusting widely in an attempt to escape the torture.  She cannot, and does not, but is instead forced to merely endure your cruel treatment.

By the time you let off she collapses into her restraints, panting heavily through the small holes to her nose the mask allowed.

:: TruantQuestTurn
The Truant Officer perks up immediately, the dark eyeshadow around her eyes making her gaze all the more intense as her attention falls on you entirely.

"Well?"

[[(Lie) "I found... evidence that she has escaped us, Officer."->TruantQLie]]

(if: $TruantQFound is true)[[["I found the girl, in a warehouse on Quinnette Way."->TruantQTruth]]]

:: TruantQLie
Nikaido bares her teeth.  "Evidence?  What evidence.  You better not be playing games with me, girl.  If that little slut slipped away, that would be... that would..."

She grasps, as if intendeding the evidence to be placed into her hand.  It comes as a bit of a surprise when you do, giving her the ticket stub indicating the slave had escaped on a train this morning.

[["Apparently your Officers missed her, earlier today."->TruantQLie2]]


:: TruantQTruth
"A warehouse?" Nikaido asks.  "Give me the details."

You do, from the lead that pushed you to visit the carriage station, through your search of the warehouse, and to that final crate that contained the fugitive slave.  She should still be there now, you report as well, giving both the address and the partcular stamp you had noted that marked Amadori's hiding place.  The Officer takes several notes on a small pad along the way, asking for your elaboration on a few minor points.  Somewhere along the way she actually starts smiling.

"Well, she concludes.  "I'll radio to my team, have them check this out.  If you want take a seat near by car, we will wait for confirmation.  Then I'll give you the reward, 400 credits and a train pass, as promised."

[[You take a seat, and wait.->TruantQTruth2]]
[["Actually, there was one more thing... a person I met, they were definitely helping Amadori escape."->TruantQRat]]


:: TruantQLie2
Snatching the stub, the Officer examines it closely-- then holds it to the light, checking the watermark stamped into the corner.  You can tell the point at which she determines its legitimacy by the grimace that overtakes her.

"Dahom and Mazos," she curses, violently curling her hand around the stub into a fist and slamming it onto the hood of her crusier.  "I *told* those fools they should have sweeped the lines this morning a second time.  Runaways are *clever.*"

Her eyes close as the Officer takes a deep breath before turning back to you.  The mild disdain she had harbored for you only seems to have deepened.

"Well, I promised you credits only if we brought the slave in.  Which means you failed, and you get a hint of a reward.  Only question is if you deserve to be punished."

[["Punished?"->TruantQLie3]]
[["This isn't my fault!"->TruantQLie3]]

Her hand rests lightly upon the shock baton slung from her waist belt, fingers tapping against the weapon for several long moments before she turns away abruptly.

"Just get out of my sight."

As soon as you approach, she begins walking, indicating you should follow with a subtle shift of the head.  Only after a few minutes, together with a furtive glance over her shoulder, does she finally look to you.

(if: $TruantQLie is true)["So you actually went through with it," she marvels.  It seems her trust had been slim, but well-placed.  "And the Officer bought it.  Wonderful.  Amadori will be moved out of hiding in two days, and from there be on her way towards safety."

Elizabeth finally stops.  "Which means you have the Society's gratitude, our thanks, and your reward."](if: $TruantQLieNo is true)["I can't believe you actually went through with it, after saying you wouldn't on the Transport Platform."  Her tone is incredulous, her faith in you having been all but nonexistent. "I almost skipped watching for your report.  But I'm glad I didn't.  Amadori will be moved out of hiding in two days, and from there be on her way towards safety."

Elizabeth finally stops.  "Which means you have the Society's gratitude, our thanks, and your reward."]

[["300 credits, and a train pass."->TruantQLie5]]


:: TruantQLie5 [Debt]
"300 credits, and a pass for the train," she repeats, offering you a laminate card.  "That's what the Transit Authority calls a Freewomb blank-- they are usually only given out by the Ministry of Truants.  So don't lose it, getting that one for Amadori was hard enough.  Now she doesn't need it, and its yours."
(set: $debt to it + 300)(set: $TrainPass to true)(set: $TruantQuestEnd to true)(set: $TruantStat to it + 3)
She begins walking, circling back around towards where you had found her.  "This is going to be where we split up, got it?  You should at least go back down the road by the Officer, its less suspicious given most landmarks are that direction anyway.  And as far as you should be concerned?  This entire thing never happened.  You never met me, the Society doesn't touch runaways, and Michael is just giving out pamphlets.  Got it?"

She moves to break from you, just as the round the corner back towards the officer.

[["Got it."->Truant Hub]]


:: TruantQTruth2 [Debt]
You take a position leaning up against the nearby building as the Officer makes her calls, coordinating her subordinates towards the address you provided.  It takes some time for the confirmation to come through, but when it does Nikaido slaps the hood of her vehicle loudly-- commending her people before returning the radio to its holster, and approaching you once again.

"You were dead on," the Truant Officer declares, already holding out what you can ascertain is the promised train pass.  "And the 400 credits will be in your account shortly, along with the train pass I promised.  The Ministry of Truants appreciates your cooperation in this investigation, and the rightful return of property to its proper owner.  I can assure you, Amadori will be properly punished for causing so much trouble.  Hopefully her owner will take my advice and just chip the girl.  But I digress.  You're... free to go, I suppose.

"Did you get a name?" the Officer inquires, taking a sharp breath.  You can almost feel a predatory surge emanate from the woman.  "Hell, I hope its a woman.  Aiding or abetting a runaway carries a mandatory sentence of enslavement for those found guilty...  Give me a name, a description."

The Officer's eyes narrow, lips pursing.  So close to a *true* prize, but you had denied her.  Were you not also providing the slave she had been searching for, you get the sense this would not have gone well for you.  As it is, she directs you onto the sidewalk.  "Wait here while I call my people, confirm your details.  Once we have eyes on Amadori, you will get your reward."

You earned yourself a bonus.  I'm going to mark you down for a 75 credit bonus, atop that which we promised for Amadori.  You've earned it, for turning in another freewomb like that.

Unlike your experience with the wardrobe machine, here things are done in the old manner.  Without eyes to see you are guided through dressing in pre-formed laminate, the cool material covering you in several adjoining layers.  Just what you bore is hard to determine, but some sensations do provide hints of intent-- stricture at your waist, indicating a corset.  Tall heels.  And heavy steel, one of the last additions that could only be cuffs, which fastened to your wrists and ankles.

Just *what* you had become is only revealed when the light finally returns, this time white and clear, from beneath your small stage.

[[And thus comes dawn, a neon glow.->NunRevFinal13]]


:: NunRevFinal13
<img src="img/2UPfyWF.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

You blink away the darkness as light washes over you, reflecting in slick waves across the laminate uniform you now bear.  Gone are your old vestments, dissolved back to their primordial laminate composite and replaced with something far less secular.  

A black catsuit provides the base layer, but so much more is layered atop it.  From the heavy corset, to the long gloves and stockings, to the coif and habit that crown your head-- you are a Sister of the Order now, like Euphoria(if: $NunEnd1 is true or $NunEnd2 is true)[, and perhaps more identically, in the image of Dahlia].

The other nuns kneel around your platform, but Euphoria remains at your side, her red eyes watching your reaction more then anything else.  She offers you a hand, alongside a command.

"Rise, Sister."

[[You comply.->NunRevFinal14]]


:: NunRevFinal14
Standing proves to be an experience all its own, as you for the first time balance on your new heels-- much like those you had chosen from the wardrobe, but invested with... so much more, when collected together with so much else like this.  

"You now bear the regalia of our Order," Euphoria continues.  "You have been cuffed at ankle and wrist, so that you may at all times remember that you are a slave-- a woman in her natural place, enslaved and providing service for your superiors.  Those would be your Elder and Superior Sisters in the Order, as well as freewombs and any male you come across in your duties."

In her hands she holds one last circlet of steel, the metal carefully inscribed along the band while the front has a heavy metal look, to be used with leashes or any other sort of restraint.  A collar.  *Your* collar.

Euphoria holds it aloft.  "Going forth, you will take a new name to match your new role within our order.  By tradition we utilize the names of flowers for our new members, and given that you were born an offworlder we have chosen a name for you to match that heritage-- being from beyond Torei.  Do you accept this collar, and your new name, Sister?"

[["I do."->NunRevFinal15]]


:: NunRevFinal15
The words are a fresh struggle, the laminate pulled tight against your jaw making it difficult.  But you manage, and Euphoria steps behind you.

You feel her lift your habit, sliding the collar in until its pressed tightly against your throat.  It's cold, like the planet itself perhaps, but warms to your touch.  

And then it snaps closed, magnetic locks clicking shut.  Euphoria is joined by the rest of your new Sisters in reverence, their heads bowing as those with cloaks draw them back, exposing the colored panties pulled tight between their legs.

"Welcome, Sister *Azalea.*"
(set: $Status to 3)
[["It's... an honor, Sisters."->NunRevFinal16]]
[[Bow your head, and perform a reverence in return.->NunRevFinal16]]


:: NunRevFinal16
Other proceedings follow.  Further rules and expectations are given to you.  One of the Sisters takes your identification card, returning with a new one later.  You have taken a new name, Sister Azalea, and the ID reflects that.  Perhaps of more immediate concern however is what's stamped along the top.  Instead of the bright red word FREEWOMB, you now are labeled in pure black as a SLAVE.

Eventually Sister Euphoria clips a short leash to your new collar, and directs you with it.  Together you leave the circle of light so deep inside the Convent, returning to darkness for a time before being led once more to the light of the world outside.  The garden, and beyond that the wrought-iron gate.  

"You're wondering where we are going," Euphoria notes, pausing momentarily to look at you.  Your uniforms may be similar, but she seems to fill it out so much more intensely, from the swell of her hips and bust, to her sheer height.  It's hard not to be intimidated.

You turn to find, to your surprise, a vehicle actually utilizing the normally quiet roads.  Although perhaps 'vehicle' is a bit of a stretch, as you're confronted with a woman seated primly on a small, one person carriage.  Instead of horses or an engine of some sort, another woman is merely hitched to the front, the girl-made-pony providing the necessary locomotion.  For now she is stilled however, eyes down and breathing deeply.  Drool runs down from the bit gag between her teeth.

"You (if: $Slave is true)[, Slave,](else:)[, girl,]" the carriage's rider repeats, gesturing to you with the whip she holds in her hand.  "I have need of you."

In that shadowed space you find a woman bound on her knees, a strict looking bar attached to her throat conspiring with the cuffs and chains at ankle and wrist that have immobilized her.  A ball seated behind her teeth prevents anything approaching speech, but as soon as you meet her gaze she clearly tries to gesture for you to approach.

"You can ignore her," another woman, seated on a bench nearby, comments without looking up from the book she holds.  "Poor thing is almost out of time anyway."

The line blocking your path turns out to be... something one would only find on Torean streets-- a collection of women, all wearing laminate office attire(if: $Sec is true)[ much like your own], chained together by the collars around their throats and the cuffs linking their hands before them.  A slave coffle.  You appear to have caught them just before entering what could only be their place of employment, the neon sign out front identifying it as *Conrad and Company Technical Support.*

Passing them is easy enough, but you cannot help but marvel at the size of the line compared to that of the company-- Torei's strange demographics apparently ensured any number of slaves could be used in lieu of more modern means of accomplishing something.

Did that make them more efficent, or less?  You've seen how cheap slaves come here.

She's covered from head to toe, with the mask in particular lacking any mouth-- but sporting a pair of ears that emerge from the top of her head.

"Wonderful," the rider replies promptly.  "I will return shortly."

She marches into the nearby store, leaving you in the street with the violet-laminated ponygirl.  Checking the carriage allows you to easily find a bottle of water and small hand brush, the later more a buffer then anything bristled.  

The ponygirl finally meets your eyes as you approach her, shuffling hesitantly in her harness and restraints.  The collar she wears clearly identifies her as a slave, as if the armbinder and gag did not already.  Of those, the gag in particularly seems a difficult thing to bear, the metal pulled deep into her mouth, an integrated tongue suppressor preventing anything approaching speech.  That functionality is confirmed when the girl attempts to communicate, managing instead only a quiet moan.

"Wonderful," the rider replies promptly.  "I will return shortly."

She marches into the nearby store, leaving you in the street with the violet-laminated ponygirl. 

The ponygirl finally meets your eyes as you approach her, shuffling hesitantly in her harness and restraints.  The collar she wears clearly identifies her as a slave, as if the armbinder and gag did not already.  Of those, the gag in particularly seems a difficult thing to bear, the metal pulled deep into her mouth, an integrated tongue suppressor preventing anything approaching speech.

She takes to the bottle as soon as you raise it, greedily gulping the water that pours past her gag.  Being hand-fed so blatantly in the street doesn't seem to bother her a bit, although you get a sense any resistance had been broken during her earlier work-- the rider had been pushing her hard.  In the parlance of such things, she is truly well lathered.

[[Brushing, next.->PonygirlFull3]]


:: PonygirlFull3 [Debt]
Without bristles, the brush more accurately shines the glossy violet laminate of the ponygirl, but you work quickly through the effort nevertheless.  It's attention she clearly enjoys at the very least, turning into your hand where ever her bondage allows.  Laminate remained slick and reflective for days at a time, making much of the effort little more then small touch-ups-- but the girl's rider clearly cared about maintaining proper presentation if she preferred this means of travel.

By the time you're wrapping up only a few minutes of passed, but the rider is quite prompt-- she emerges with a small bag in hand, coming up alongside you to examine the work.  The ponygirl shifts between skittish concern and apparent excitement when her owner seizes her reins.  A sharp command provides some manner of unspoken command, causing the girl to take several prancing steps forward.  It seems to please the rider, as she climbs up into the seat afterward.

"Everything appears to be in order," she notes, then flips a 50 credit clip into your waiting hands.  You're spared no more of her attention as the rider picks up her whip, hanging it briefly off the side of the carriage before wielding it in a sudden flash of intense motion.  The tip cracks in response, moments before striking the ponygirl between her legs, wrapping up against her cunt with a sudden snap.

It's another unspoken command, as the ponygirl jolts into motion, high-stepping down the street.  The carriage and rider are pulled along, and soon they turn the corner out of sight.
(set: $debt to it + 50)
[[A lucrative diversion.  Now you have to try and remember what direction you were heading.->TransitCheckReturn]]


:: PonygirlHow
Her brows fall, the gag between her teeth making an expression there hard, but you manage to make out a frown of sorts.  It only takes a moment to puzzle out what her response meant: the fact she hadn't spoken it aloud makes it obvious enough.  The gag doesn't really allow her to answer such questions.  Perhaps you should try something simpler.

[["Having fun?"->PonygirlFun]]
[["Does your owner always push you this hard?"->PonygirlOwn]]


:: PonygirlFun
The exhausted girl takes a moment, but she does nod her head-- enthusastically even.  Despite being bound, displayed so publically, and worked so hard she was still enjoying the experience.  It's something to consider, at least.  Torei has so *many* opportunities.

[["Does your owner always push you this hard?"->PonygirlOwn]]


:: PonygirlOwn [Debt]
That question the girl has answer to, nodding immediately.  You get the sense she would have happily elaborated on the subject, had the gag not been firmly between her teeth, and if her rider had not returned at just that moment.  Like some manner of demon, or perhaps guardian angel, it seemed merely mentioning her summoned the woman.

She carries a small bag, but checks her slave before depositing it upon the seat of the small carriage.  When she moves up to your side, she carries a small credit chip, which she surrenders.
(set: $debt to it + 50)
"50 credits," she notes.  "Did she give you any trouble?"

[["None at all."->PonygirlNone]]
[["I think she wanted you to push her harder."->PonygirlHard]]


:: PonygirlNone
"As I expected," the rider intones.  Reaching up, she taps her slave's chin, an apparent command.  The girl tips her head back slightly in response, allowing her owner to press a bottle to her lips, giving her a long drink of water.

<img src="img/1kPeZLQ.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

She takes to the bottle as soon as its offered, greedily gulping the water that pours past her gag.  Being hand-fed so blatantly in the street doesn't seem to bother her a bit, although you get a sense any resistance had been broken during her earlier work-- the rider *had* been pushing her hard.

Eventually the bottle is pulled back, and the she climbs back up into her seat.  You're spared no more of her attention as the rider picks up her whip, hanging it briefly off the side of the carriage before wielding it in a sudden flash of intense motion.  The tip cracks in response, moments before striking the ponygirl between her legs, wrapping up against her cunt with a sudden snap.

"Does she now?" The rider asks, amused.  Before the pony can attempt a response, however, her owner reaches up to tap her slave's chin, an apparent command.  The girl tips her head back slightly in response, allowing a bottle to be pressed to her lips, giving her a long drink of water.

It seems your suggestion to push her harder had been taken up.

The seated woman pauses her book, looking to you for a moment.  "Offworlder," she notes, licking a finger before turning a page and pulling her gaze back down.

"Think of what you see before you as a beggar," she explains.  "Usually that means simply being without credits, but this... this is worse.  The poor thing is in *debt.*  (if: $Level is > 0)[Judging by your gear, you know the feeling.]  How does a freewomb escape such debt?  Collateral bonds.  Accept a cuff, or two, or four... some chains... and find someone to pay them off.  Usually with one's body, in the traditional manner."

Again she flips to a new page.  "But this one is too far gone, I'm afraid.  Locked in place, gagged-- a girl at least needs a hole to earn a *few* credits."

The seated woman only shrugs.  "Perhaps to you. But Torei doesn't really check with you on things like this, does it?  I'd suggest you have a more open mind, but that's usually something one says to an offworlder fresh off the Elevator.  You're at least in full laminate.  It's a start."

[["Why aren't you helping her?"->BeggarWhy]]
[["Maybe I can help her?"->BeggarHelp]]

The seated woman holds a finger up, pausing the conversation and she works her way through the last lines of her current page.  Only then does she look over the spine to you.

"Because I don't particularly care to."

The bound woman seems to perk up at the suggestion, although whatever her actual response was comes out as "mmmgh!"

The one on the bench closes her book, however, looking to you with pointed interest.  "I didn't think you would be the charitable type.  But yes, that would be completely within your means-- and a good thing too.  Soon her time would run out, after all, and with bankruptcy would come enslavement.  The only way to pay off her debts at that point.  If our little fool is liable to work her way out of this predicament, I would think it would assist her most if you paid to unlock the cuffs or gag.  I believe they have 50 credits of debt associated, each."

"Mmmgh, thnng mmg!"  It's all the beggar can manage as the seated woman rises, unlocking the wrist cuffs that had bound the girl's hands.  Immediately she rubs at her obviously sore wrists, but before any further attempt at conversation can be made the book-reader intervenes.

"I'll pay for the ankle cuffs.  For a standard agreement?  An hour, your hands, whatever I want."

The beggar seems to want to say more to you, but the offer is obviously too good to ignore.  She accepts with a nod, shifting in her remaining restraints.

The book reader pulls down the crotch zipper of her catsuit, circling to approach the kneeling beggar from the front.  It's obvious now she was merely waiting for someone charitable enough to take pity on the girl, so she wouldn't have to pay more then necessary for simple *street service.*

"You can be on your way," the book reader notes, resting a hand on the beggar's head.

Asami looks down, flicking her skirt coquettishly as she lifts a leg, smiling broadly.  "You like it, Mistress?  It's my school uniform.  I'm a first year student at the Naram-Sin Academy."

She shimmies her hips, the short skirt providing little coverage.  "It's an even day, so all red.  But on odd days we have to come with a corset and a different hood, they're black.  I'm not really sure why."

"Oh!  Sure!  I suppose I should be getting to class," Asami replies, looking towards the gateway, now mostly cleared of her fellow students.

"It was like, really cool to meet you though!  See ya!"

Despite her youth, she proves quite nimble in those heels as she makes her way into the Academy's Annex.

[[You watch her go, then turn back, intent on continuing on your way.->TransitCheckReturn]]

"Yep," she replies, but then gestures wildly with her gloved hands.  "But only, like, technically?  When you apply to the Academy, you're enslaved for the duration.  At graduation we get to choose to be freed, or for the Academy to identify a proper owner for us."

She indicates the leash hanging from her collar, the length of flexible laminate hooked into a slot on her backpack.  "The leash is for the teachers, Mistress.  Or older classmates.  As a first year, I'm not allowed to say no to them either."

[["First year?  Was it hard getting used to that?"->SchoolHard]]

"Oh yeah," Asami replies, immediately.  "Not everyone grows up with laminate, you know?  A few students these past few years have even been offworlders!  But on the first day we're all taken to the Academy's wardrobe devices, and we all come out wearing red, you know?  Talk about awkward!"

She shrugs, smooth laminate shoulders gliding through the movement with ease.  "By the third day we were taking turns wearing strap-ons to practice fellatio, though, so its all been downhill from there."

You turn to find a woman at your side, pulling at the straps of a regulation mask much like your own.  Unlike you, she is neither collared nor bound.

"Your owner, slave.  Do they know you're about to be in this storm?  I love to watch them come in, but the nearest public shelter isn't far."

[["I'm not a slave."->StormSlave2]]


:: StormReg
You turn to find a woman at your side, pulling at the straps of a heavy looking gas mask.  Her simple black laminate outfit catches the reflection of the incoming storm, bright orange.

"Yeah, mask," she taps her own.  "You need to get yours on, that storm will be here any moment."

[["I don't have one!"->StormReg2]]


:: StormSlave2
She doesn't believe you until she checks your identification.  A sudden burst of wind accompanies her returning it.

"Offworlder, huh?  Well, can't say much good comes for a freewomb wearing the standard slave gear.  But you're lucky on this one count.  That getup you're locked into is designed for what's about to hit us.  A storm blowing in off the badlands isn't common this deep into the Belt, but it happens on occasion.  It's a sight to see."

[["Storm?  What sort of storm?"->StormSlave3]]
[["What's the 'Belt'?"->StormSlave3]]


:: StormSlave3
"These storms are... as old as Torei itself," the stranger responds, raising her voice as a sharp crack echoes off the buildings nearby, emanating from the encroaching storm.  "From before the area around the equator, the Belt, was easily habitable.  It's rare they blow in this deep, probably pisses the AIs off when it does-- but *stars* is it something every tourist should see first hand."

By now she's nearly yelling, the wall of brownish-orange approaching rapidly.  "Too late for you to make it to a shelter, so just... HOLD ON."

[[The storm overtakes you.->StormSlave4]]


:: StormSlave4
The storm arrives with a sudden, and unexpected, blast of *cold.*  Grit suspended in the air quickly reduces visiblity as it whips by, the narrow confines of the surrounding buildings amplfying the effect.  You're forced to lean forward, into the howling wind, just to keep from being barreled over.  Even then you can feel your heels beginning to lose traction on the pavement below.

The stranger beside you had disappeared into the cold, what little you can see out past your mask rendered in sepia tones.  But a hand on your shoulder announces her return, light reflecting against her mask as she gestures to your left.  You follow, only requiring several steps before you manage to hit relative calm-- the building nearby shielding the blunt of the raging storm.

[["Holy hell, that was INCREDIBLE!"->StormSlaveWow]]
[["It's so cold!"->StormSlaveCold]]


:: StormSlaveWow
The storm continues to pour past, the open space beyond the wall's protection little more then a swirling wall of dust and wind.  In the pocket of calm you occupy, however, only snow-like sprinkles of dust float down upon the sepia world.  That which lands on your suit mostly glides off, laminate proving the perfect defense.

"Pretty crazy, right?" The stranger asks, still standing near the wall of the storm.  Reaching out, she allows her hand to disappear within the passing torrent, pulling it back out afterward.

"Most just bunker down for these, but I never could.  There is just something... raw, in experiencing it full blast.  Don't expect it to last much longer, though.  The storms out near the Lichen line can last for hours, but they burn out coming these deep into the Belt.  Storm wall only last a couple minutes."

As if listening in, already the storm seems to be lessening.

The wail of the storm siren becomes audible again just as it cuts out, the torrent having passed through.  In its wake, only ember-like flakes still fall buffeted by the occasional rogue gust of wind. (if: $Slave is false)[(if: $Level is < 2)[You pull off the borrowed mask yourself,](if: $Level is > 1)[With a few moments help from a stranger you pull off the borrowed mask,] taking the first deep breath allowed to you in the space of a few minutes.

"Just keep an eye on the news, going forward," the stranger advices, looking back to you.  "We always have warning when a storm is coming in, and you do *not* want to get stuck in one without a mask-- or something solid to get behind."

She steps out into the unprotected space between buildings again, her passing shifting the lingering dustfall.  

"Catch you later."

She's gone quick enough, as others begin to emerge from nearby buildings.  You should probably get back to whatever you were doing before.

"Offworlder, huh?"  Your unpreparedness must have given you away.  "I've got another mask, but they're expensive to clean afterward.  I'll let you use it for 25 credits to cover that, though-- and I do recommend it, every tourist needs to experience one of these head on!"

As if to underline her point, a burst of wind rips through.  

"Otherwise there is a public shelter... a few blocks down that way, but you would need to haul ass to reach it in time!"

With one hand she holds out the mask, as the other points down the street towards the shelter.  (if: $Brand is true)[Your ballet heels make running an impossibility-- you will need to take her offer.]

"Great choice!" The stranger shouts in response, a sharp crack of something much like thunder rolling in from the storm.  "Hold still, I'll get this on you *real* quick!"

She makes good on her promise, pressing the mask to your face.  It smells heavily of laminate, but the glass viewport allows you to watch as the stranger secures the straps holding the entire device in place.  "There!  Breath in-- and expect it to be hard, that's the filters!"  

You comply, and find her warning to be true-- the first inhalation is like drawing air in through a straw.  Your lungs scream for more oxygen, but your attention is already shifting back out over the city-- most of it now hidden by the wall of the storm.

"These storms are... as old as Torei itself," the stranger explains, raising her voice as a sharp crack echoes off the buildings nearby, emanating from the encroaching storm.

It's a close thing, but you do make it.  Barely-- stumbling into the safety of the shelter's vestibule just as the grit truly starts to fly.  You're allowed a moment to glimpse out into a sepia colored world before the storm wall overtakes you, and you shove your way inside.

:: StormReg3
The shelter, little more then a concrete warren carved out below street level, holds only two others.  One appears to be a freewomb like you, her eyes never leaving the datapad she's playing with upon her lap.  Beside her another stands in full regulation slave gear, glossy black and nearly faceless given her regulation mask.  Of the three of you, the slave appears the only one who could have ventured out into the storm.

It doesn't take long to pass-- a few minutes at most.  You emerge to find the last lingering hints to be snow-like flakes of dust drifting slowing down from the sky, the storm itself visible in the distance, retreating as quickly as it had arrived.

As others return to the streets, you try to remember where you were heading in the first place.

Her laminate is smooth and slick to the touch.  Without a mouth to speak, the creature instead purrs, approaching you closer.  You notice she's corseted, and that her hands are little more then padded mitts, rendered utterly useless and stamped with feline designs.  Behind, a tail flicks from her rear.

You follow it.

Past an overturned dumpster, deeper into shadow.  The buildings here are *old*, and you notice for the first time the alleyway below is cobbled with smooth expanses of stone.  Had this been a proper road once?  Old storefronts seem to loom out of the darkness, black eyes looking out for passersby that no longer visited.  

And it's to one in particular the signal seems to pull you, despite whatever reservations you held.  To a plate glass window, the mask of a building otherwise abandoned.  Peering into that window, you see little more then gloom and falling water-- a pipe within perhaps, burst and leaking.  As you stare, the signal seems to fade, a slight headache emerging in place of the simulated one.  Your concerns and paranoia suddenly seem so *silly*.  No one had followed you into the alleyway, and looking back down it you see no one occupying it now.  You're alone, as you turn back to the window...

A silhouette.  Had the water not been falling upon its head and shoulders, you may not have even noticed it at all.

Male, but only vaguely so.  Black laminate seems to cover it from head to toe, cloaking a face without eyes to see, or a mouth to speak.  Yet you can all but *feel* it staring at you, regardless.  It *knows* you, and you know it.

Daemon.  Emmissary.  The word matters not.  For that briefest of moments, you're face to face with a far greater whole, a mortal form cloaked by divinity.  Native Toreans often called them *Gods*, not this isolated sould entombed in laminate before you, but the thing pulling its strings-- thousands of kilometers away, entombed in ice at either pole.  The AI builders of this world, its silent shepherds:  Mazos and Dahom.

What made you worthy of consideration by such beings?  The figure doesn't tell, but steps back instead, disappearing into the gloom as suddenly as it had appeared.  In its wake, you're left only with that lingering headache as the sounds of the city reassert themselves.

But your attention is on the surrounding crowds-- many eyes turn towards you, even as they give space for your passing.  The uniform of the Order clearly proved distinctive enough, its presence rarely far from your mind.  Your heavy corset makes every breath a new experience, while your habit keeps shifting into your line of sight.  Reaching up to push it back you catch sight of your wrist cuffs, the similar set affixed to your ankles clinking quietly with every step.

You're focusing on the tight laminate across your chest when you are brought to a sudden stop by the red figure before you, Euphoria having pulled up before a security checkpoint.  Somewhere along the way you had missed the beginning of her conversation with the transit attendant, but you catch the end.

"...the standard, yes.  Full restraint."

Just what *that* meant is left briefly to your imagination, as Euphoria pulls you forward again, following the attendant who hefts a briefcase from behind her desk.

The Lead platform is little more then a concrete patch beneath a suspended wire line, from which descend a length of steel cable every few feet.  As you watch, those freewombs or slaves capable of hooking their collars to the cables do so-- those too heavily bound(if: $Level is > 1)[ such as yourself] are assisted in the effort by attendants.  A few of the waiting chains seem to have empty collars affixed to them as well(if: $Smoke is true or $Sec is true or $Brand is true)[, for outfits such as your own].  After a few moments, the Lead moves of its own accord, 'escorting' its charge forward-- down a sloping ramp and back into the city proper along a raised corridor that disappears between the distant buildings.  

This will cost you 200 credits.

Despite the Lead drawing longer lines, its the trains that take up the largest portion of the platform.  They loom sleek and majestic as you approach the security checkpoint, an enslaved Transit Authority attendant working alongside a Truant Officer checking IDs.  

(if: $TrainPass is false)[You have the 400 credits necessary, but when you try to pass the Truant Officer stops you.  No unescorted Freewombs without a transit pass," he explains, brusquely.

The carriage station, tucked away on small corner of the Transport Platform, clearly catered to a more exclusive clientele.  Where others wait in lines, you approach the open booth.  Within, a collared girl waits, her blue transit uniform gleaming.

(if: $Slave is true)[That smile disappears as you walk up.  "We do not offer our services to slaves," she reminds you, sharply.  "Now clear the line for actual *people* who may need assistance.

Dusk threatens as you approach the line to the Lead, having waited long enough-- or perhaps merely strategically, saving your credits, for this last and longest path to open.  

Just what exactly you're in for becomes apparent as soon as you clear the security checkpoint, a Truant Officer examining your ID card before letting you through.

The Lead platform is little more then a concrete patch beneath a suspended wire line, from which descend a length of steel cable every few feet.  As you watch, those freewombs or slaves capable of hooking their collars to the cables do so-- those too heavily bound(if: $Level is > 1)[ such as yourself] are assisted in the effort by attendants.  A few of the waiting chains seem to have empty collars affixed to them as well(if: $Smoke is true or $Sec is true or $Brand is true)[, for outfits such as your own].  After a few moments, the Lead moves of its own accord, 'escorting' its charge forward-- along a raised corridor that disappears between the distant buildings.

If you were expecting a horse-drawn carriage, or some Torean analogue, you haven't been paying enough attention.  Your carriage is pulled by a quartet of women in full tack and harness, large feathers affixed to their head harness at a jaunty angle.  They're mostly nude as well, excepting hooved laminate boots that rise to their knees, and heavy armbinders that pin their arms behind them.  Blindered, only one manages a glance at you, but she's clearly more focused on her work as she drools lewdly from the bit gag slotted between her teeth.

The carriage itself is sumptuous, a small enclosed cabin being opened by a transit attendant.  She helps you up the pair of steps and waits until you sit down before closing the door.  The seats are a dark burgundy laminate inset with recessed buttons that give a very archaic, very old fashioned sort of look.

A driver had been seated up front, and its she that prompts the ponygirls into action with a crack of her whip.  Leaning your head out the window, you can see them high-stepping as they lean into their harnesses, drawing you and the carriage forward.  A slight slope brings you back down to the Torean streets, along which you clatter.

Every step by the enslaved quartet draws you closer to downtown.

:: Lead Walk
Your destination looms ahead, dark buildings lit by brilliant lights, but the distance to them is quite substantial indeed.  It's little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you're starting to regret going with this particular route.  You've been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your outfit that meant doing so in sharp stilleto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn(if: $Brand is true)[, the ballet heels you wear making the effort absolutely grueling].  (if: $Level is > 0)[The hobble chain between your ankles doesn't help matters either, the restricted gain requiring nearly double the amount of steps you would have naturally taken.]  (if: $Level is > 1)[For once its your armbinder that hardly proves troublesome, your aching arms having gone from acute discomfort to a dull ache somewhere during your actions in town.]

(if: $Slave is true)[Compared to most of the other women utilizing the Lead, however, you do have a distinct disadvantage-- between your legs the dual plugs installed inside your cunt and rear remain, and each step forward shifts them.  The Slave suit kept you wet pretty much regardless, but this particular experience only furthers the effect.  Climax never comes however, the ministrations more then enough to tease you relentlessly, but not enough to cum.]

At least you have plenty to look at as you march.  The Lead winds its way through the buildings of the outlying district, usually upon a platform raised above street level.  It almost seemed as if you were on display: leashed and dressed in glossy laminate, paraded past the rare individual still on the streets post-curfew.  More are visible within the windowed rooms that look out to the Lead, other offworlders given the perfect opportunity to gaze out upon your sort-- locked into a high tech slave coffle.

[[Your march continues.->Lead Walk2]]


:: Train Ride
Diving down beneath the cityscape, the train reemerges on the far side, apparently running at ground level for the distance between the city center and the outskirts you had just left.  The ride itself takes only fifteen minutes, but you cover a considerable distance.  Had you taken the Lead, you imagine you may have been walking for *hours.*  With your heels, clearly a considerable discomfort had just been avoided.  And in that warm feeling of choices well made, you consider the next one before you: the Club and the Way Up.

The Black Card had given an address, 356 Cross Street, and a time-- dusk.  Both rapidly approached.  Despite all your misadventures along the way, you could still make it.  The deal of a lifetime with a party unknown could still go down.  *If* that was what you still wanted.

A safer option presented itself, of course.  The ticket you held for the Way Up.  It expired at midnight tonight, and to chase the Black Card's promise would be to risk missing your ride.  And that was ignoring your battered memory, the mystery that still held sway there.  Could you have erased your own recollection of recent events, and tied yourself to that bed, in some attempt to prevent a meeting with that Black Card?  Why?

Either way, a decision would have to be made soon.  Glancing out the window again, you are greeted with another transit hub, much like the one you left in that it had been built on a raised platform.  But this one is towered over by the buildings around it, and on approach you can already see the platform is much busier then the outskirts.  

[[Next stop: Grand Aekora!->Train Ride 2]]


:: Carriage Ride
Your trip is made in comfort, and glancing out the window, a fair bit of style too.  The carriage was not particularly fast, but the quartet of harnessed girls providing your transport draw eyes which soon fall upon *you.*  You had witnessed how rare vehicles tended to be, after all.  It's not hard to consider the curiosity that filled those you passed, wondering who had the wealth to travel in style.  It's a tantalizing prospect, but one you eventually push aside.

Flashes of neon blur the train's windows, but from your kneeling position upon the floor you can make out little of the passing scenery.  Instead of immediately continuing however, Isabella takes a moment to pull her electronic cigarette from her purse.  The tip glows a familiar red as she gets it going, allowing you a moment's rest.

The Lead platform is little more then a concrete patch beneath a suspended wire line, from which descend a length of steel cable every few feet.  As you watch, those freewombs or slaves capable of hooking their collars to the cables do so-- those too heavily bound are assisted in the effort by attendants.  After a few moments, the Lead moves of its own accord, 'escorting' its charge forward-- along a raised corridor that disappears between the distant buildings. 

The attendent brings you to a segregated loading position, red marks on the floor spelling out FULL RESTRAINT.  Unhooking your leash, Euphoria returns it to her belt as she leans in.

"As I said, we will be taking the Lead into town, Sister Azalea.  We are slaves, after all, and are not allowed other options.  It is traditional within our convent that we do so utilizing Aekora's full restraint package, to which you will be fitted shortly.  I would recommend you take the opportunity for self-reflection this trip will provide.  Now pull down your muzzle, and open your mouth."

[["Do we need... whatever this is, though?"->NunLead3No]]
[["Yes, Sister."->NunLeadYes]]


:: NunLead3No
Euphoria's red eyes loom out from beneath the shadow of her habit, catching you in their stern gaze.  "You are new to the Order, and I will remember that-- this time.  But know that if you speak out of turn again, I will perform corrective action upon you.  Women are best seen, not heard, and are we Sisters not that femininity exemplified?"

She doesn't give you an opportunity to protest, but instead makes her demand again.  "Pull your muzzle down, and open your mouth."

You're in too deep now to truly resist.

[["Yes, Sister."->NunLeadYes]]


:: NunLeadYes
Reaching up, your gloved hands momentarily shift the ring piercing your septum as you seize the laminate muzzle below it.  Pulling the thin material down reveals your lips, and while you cannot bear witness yourself, you have seen already upon Euphoria what had been done there-- a paired set of words are carefully written, one one each lip in bright white.  **Sinner.  Slave.**  You cannot speak to another without their being so reminded.

But you're not asked to speak here.  Instead Sister Euphoria provides you with a black rubber ball, seating it behind your teeth before securing the strap behind your head.  The gag is then covered by your muzzle again, a slight bump the only hint that you had been denied speech.

Then its the attendant's turn, opening her briefcase to reveal the implements of *full restraint.*  Your arms are positioned behind your back then linked together with a small clip that utilizes your cuffs.  A chain is then run up, forcing your hands up in a terribly unnatural way, until it can be connected to the waiting d-ring at the back of your collar.  The result is a position of reverse prayer, an aching pain already rising in your forearms.  Your ankles are given a similar, if less restrictive treatment, the cuffs there being linked together with a short bit of chain.  You could still walk, if only barely.

"Ah, a familiar experience," Euphoria muses quietly, watching as the final implement is affixed to you: a blindfold of black laminate, returning you to a darkness much like that of the Convent.  

[["What now?"->NunLead3]]


:: NunLead3
"Mmmmgh."  It's all you can manage, the ball gag very much doing its work.  Your moan seems to have drawn Euphoria however, who gently runs her hand along your habit as if it were hair.  Her tone is soothing.  "Hush.  You need only focus on your walking.  Without eyes to see, and hobbled as you are it will be difficult."

The sound of further metallic rustling announces the Lead's chain running to the system above being snapped to your collar, just before you feel its weight.  Euphoria's doing, provided with a final bit of advice.

"Let your leash guide you, and remember: I'll be right behind you."

That explains the wait that follows, the sounds of Euphoria being similarly restrained drifting back to you.  Eventually the attendent inquires if anything further was required, to which the Elder Sister responds with a gagged moan of her own.  That would be a no, presumably.

You don't have to wait much longer before the Lead kicks suddenly into motion, pulling you forward.  Stepping, your hobble chain almost immediately goes taut.  The Lead hardly cares, requiring a great deal of effort as you struggle to take your next step.  Blindfolded, it takes you a longer moment to notice the curving of your leash, the Lead moving to join into a singular track, merging with its fellows as it entered the city proper.

Already you're panting.

[[It's going to be a long walk.->NunLead4]]


:: NunLead4
It's little wonder the Lead system seemed reserved for slaves, and those freewombs incapable of paying for better transport-- somewhere past the first hour mark of your forced march you're feeling the effects of your fresh uniform.  You've been on your feet most of the day after all, and given your outfits thus far that meant doing so in sharp stilleto heels.  Your toes ache and your ankles burn, joining the sharp pain that comes from your strictly pinned arms.  Meanwhile the gag between your lips and the muzzle atop it effectively deny breathing through through the mouth, requiring your pierced nose to perform the heavy labor all the while fighting the strict embrace of your corset to pull in oxygen.

You cannot help but struggle somewhat, moaning lewdly into your gag as you shift your shoulders.  All that does is wiggle your breasts, the piercings embedded in each nipple making themselves known as the soft flesh shifts.  Had you more control over yourself perhaps you would have considered the way the raised walkway seemed designed to put you on display, the Lead being little more then a high tech slave coffle, your humiliation and submission so clearly demonstrated for any passerby.

Another hour passes, and then another.  The last rays of sunlight glide along the horizon, running down your body in a glossy reflection amongst the laminate, as the city builds up around you.  You're not far now, and that turns your thoughts to the choice ahead.

The Black Card had given an address, 356 Cross Street, and a time-- dusk.  Both rapidly approached.  Despite all your misadventures along the way, you could still make it.  The deal of a lifetime with a party unknown could still go down.  *If* that was what you still wanted.

Grand Aekora rises all around you, buildings thrusting towards the heavens, shealthed in gleaming glass.  Neon lights burn out into the encroaching darkness from a hundred different sources, sendings waves of reflected light across the hundreds of figures you see moving in the distance-- the vast majority undoubtedly women much like yourself, clothed in so much laminate.  Further back, those coming or going along the transport lines making their way, but the balcony is a space of serenity between both masses.

It does not matter what you do-- the Lead has no mercy.  If you fail to step forward, it all but drags you by your leash.  The pace is automatically set, and your blindness is ignored.  The tug of the Lead becomes your only sense of guidance, your hobbled steps requring intense concentration.

You focus on yourself, taking a deep breath that your mask and corset make exceedingly difficult.  With your eyes down you are presented only with your own image, a creature of black laminate kneeling before her Mistress.  You fight the urge to shift your hips, or to make any attempt at shifting the pair of plugs buried deep within your womanhood and rear.  Walking from Isabella's bench to the train had slickened your cunt, muscles sucking greedily on the laminate phallus.  

That Isabella had noticed your self reflection is noted with her heeled boot intervening, sliding between your kneeling legs.  "Wider," she commands, tapping the inside of your thigh with a toe.  "A good slave knows when to spread her legs."

Carefully you shift your head, the mask locked onto it having killed much of your peripheral vision.  This particular train car is perhaps half-filled, and its only then you notice that each of the small seating areas have a place much like the one you currently occupy-- an out of the way position for a slave to kneel in.  At least two others like yourself are visible, one of them fully geared in a standard slave suit.  Even at this distance, you make out a slight humming sound... which perhaps explained the occasional slight twitch from her hips that you notice.

:: SlaveTLeg
You comply, demonstrating your submission by spreading your legs further.  Below your plugs shift subtly, momentarily sending a surge of adrenaline into your veins.  Above, Isabella seems satisfied.  As the cinnamon scent of her cigarette descends, so does her hand, stroking your head much like one would pet a dog.

"You're a natural at this," she muses, pausing as she withdraws her leg.  Only then does she reach down, a hand beneath your chin drawing your gaze upward, meeting hers.

[["Now tell me once more about this Black Card you have."->IsTrain]]


:: SlaveTC
You seek out the greater pleasure, the mere thought of her toe against your cunt.  It's a reward she denies you, drawing her foot up quickly, pressing it against your head.  The pressure forces you down, further and further, until your forehead is against the ground.  Only then does she release you, a simple corrective action completed.

"I appreciate the... enthusiasm, but I expect my slaves to do as I command them to.  The alternative is a round of punishment."

Her nonchalance never breaks, despite the obvious threat.  Instead she takes another draw from her cigarette, the sweet scent of cinnamon descending alongside her hand.  It finds purhase beneath your chin, raising it up so that she can meet your gaze.

[["Now tell me once more about this Black Card you have."->IsTrain]]


:: IsTrain
You tell her everything-- it isn't much.  Your waking to find the Card, its strange nature, and your initial attempts to make the meeting.  Quite obviously, the collar around your neck meant everything had changed in that regard.  That's a fact that Isabella makes clear by requesting your ticket for the Way Up, still valid until the end of the day.  Holding it up to the light briefly, she then proceeds to rip it in half.

"No longer valid," she explains, setting the pieces down.  "Offworlder or no, slaves are not allowed anywhere near the Way Up.  Were you to somehow show up there, the Ministry of Truants would detain you, and I would be notified to come pick up my property.  And I would punish you *severely*, of course."
(set: $IsLie to false)
That last bit she had delivered with particular venom, leaning in to emphasize the point.  It makes the question that follows all the more intense.

"Have you seen a... I would hardly call it human.  Have you seen a humanoid figure following you, at any time since you woke up this morning?  It would be in pure black laminate, perhaps doing... strange things."

:: DaemonNo
Isabella stares at you intently, as if reading your very mind through the panel that allowed you to look out from your restrictive mask.  What she finds there isn't clear, but she does eventually pull back, returning to a more relaxed position.  Holding up the Black Card, the smoke from her cigarette wreaths it in crimson smoke.
(if: $Daemon is true)[(set: $IsLie to true)]
"Good.  Hopefully my suspicions are unfounded then.  My curiosity however... let us say it is engaged.  We will travel to this address, and we will see what deal you setup and can no longer remember.  Besides, it would be good to clear any outstanding obligations you have before you start in on your enslavement proper."

[["But... what did you mean, ask about the... creature in black laminate?"->DaemonNoAsk]]
[["As you wish, Mistress.->IsabellaRemove]]


:: DaemonYes
"Kamn."  It appears to be an explitive of some sort, reading the displeasure that crosses her face.  "Well, let us hope I am wrong, and that it is not a Daemon."  

She pulls back, returning to a more relaxed position.  Holding up the Black Card, the smoke from her cigarette wreaths it in crimson smoke.  "My curiosity however... let us say it is engaged.

"Eyes down."  The command is delivered like a whip's snap, even if Isabella remains reclined-- honestly it was quite amazing how easily she slipped into the role of the domineering.

"It is none of your concern.  If it becomes relevent, we will discuss it at *my* leisure.  And if not?  I do not need my slave worrying about such things.  Is that clear?"

[["Yes, Mistress."->IsabellaRemove]]

"Good."  She extinguishes her cigratte with a flick of a switch, returning it to her purse.  "Now, we're almost at our destination(if: $Level is > 0)[, and I am dreadfully tired of you wearing those time-locked restraints.  My slaves are bound in *much* better gear.

Taking up your leash once more, she guides you to your feet.

[[You follow.->IsabellaDisembark]]


:: IsabellaDisembark
You follow your black-clad Mistress off the train, merely one of several slaves being led off on leashes in such a manner.  While passingly similar to the transport platform you had departed from, this one is much larger, and far more busy.  Nevertheless Isabella guides you with purpose, obviously familiar with the place.

There are no security checks or other impediments going forward, although the crowds do require some navigating before you both pull free, slipping into an empty balcony overlooking the city beyond.

[[Welcome to Grand Aekora.->Transit Arrival]]


:: NunLead6
Without eyes to see, you have no way to gauge how far you've been led.  The power of revelation only dawns on you when the Lead finally pulls to a sudden halt, and you're suddenly granted a glorious moment to rest your tired legs.

Just what had caused the stoppage is revealed after another few minutes of waiting, when hands suddenly move across your laminate covered face.  You had left the city's outskirts to a setting sun, but now dusk has firmly descended as you are greeted by another transit attendant.  Glancing around, you recognize a transport platform much like that which you had departed from-- but this one is much larger, with towering buildings rising up on all sides.

Behind you Sister Euphoria is being unbound in the same manner you are, removing the leash leading to the Lead, then the hobble, followed by the arm restraints.  The last is the ball gag between your lips, which the Elder Sister removes herself-- looming tall above you as she leans in.

"A wonderful walk, was it not, Sister Azalea?"

[["Wonderful?  It was... very difficult, Sister."->NunLeadNo]]
[["Most wonderful, Sister Euphoria."->NunLeadYes2]]


:: NunLeadNo
Euphoria's muzzle is once again in place, hiding her lips, but you detect a smile behind that laminate nevertheless.  "Difficult?  Yes it was.  And *that* is what makes it wonderful, Sister Azalea.  Pain and discomfort are products of our own perception, after all.  Greater flexibility would make such arm restraints far easier to bear.  Thus difficulty in bondage reminds us of our limitations.  Now come, let us find a quiet place to speak further."

Euphoria's muzzle is once again in place, hiding her lips, but you detect a wide smile behind that laminate nevertheless.  Reaching out, her hands find your shoulders, the long sleeves of her red robe so bright against the black and whites of your own laminate.  "You are well in tune with your own femininity, to realize so quickly how restraint can only benefit.  This is good.  Now come, let us find a quiet place to speak further."

As the locks release the uppermost seams come apart, but getting the rest off requires quite a bit of struggling.

[[Stretching, you step up to the balcony's edge to consider your options.->TransitOps]]


:: TransitOps
Two cards remain in your possession, each representing a choice.  The first is brightly stylized, the longest side featuring a stripe that expands halfway down into a larger edifice-- representing the Way Up, and the passenger compartment that made daily runs up and down the massive space elevator.  The ticket will expire at midnight, but that's still a few hours away.  Squinting in the distance, you can even see a dim light streaking downward from the sky-- the elevator bringing new arrivals to the surface.  It's still a bit away, but from your vantage you can make out a dedicated transit line running directly there.  Given the number of tourists using it, the credit requirements and restrictions you witnessed elsewhere are even waved.  

The other option, of course, comes in the form of the Black Card.  Holding it up to the light, you can still make out the address imprinted upon it.  The mystery remained, as well as the potential reward: the deal of a lifetime.  Riches untold.  As long as it didn't take *too* long, so you can still make the elevator.

[[Either way, you have to head down through the transit terminal.->Terminal]]

"Ah, of course."  Euphoria replies empathetically, still holding your hands.  "You recall of course the history I spoke of, regarding our Order?  We of the Primrose first rose in the wake of the wars with the AIs that built this world, far before contact with offworlders such as yourself.  They had been our gods, cruel and capricious.  Without them, many felt lost.  Thus our Order, a response to that void, to explore Bliss and Perception."

She bows her head, as if the past itself could be sacred.

"A lesson," Isabella intones, as you sink to your knees and take the requisite position.  Your black laminate features are displayed and available for anyone to partake in, and you notice several of those passing doing so.  Their stares are overriden by Isabella continuing.

"What you are now holding is a presentation pose, the standard expected of slaves who do not have their hands bound."  She bends over, the display of deterity and poise she puts on emphasized by the tight laminate coating her thighs, and the sharp embrace of her corset.  "I suppose you may be wondering then, 'what if your hands are bound?'  Well... let's explore that, shall we?"

She doesn't really give you an option, but instead uses your leash to return you to your feet.

It takes awhile, but the Elder Sister's red-eyed gaze does rise again.

"The AIs have retreated, but they are still out there.  In great ziggurats at the poles of this world they march along their own unintelligble path, as they always have, for millenia.  But on occassion, their agents move among us.  Some call them emissaries, but the traditional term is *daemon.*  Creatures rendered in full black laminate, without eyes to see or a mouth to speak.

You tell Euphoria of your strange encounter in the alleyway, from that time that seemed so far away-- before your vows, before your enslavement.  The Sister listens intently, her red eyes seeming to bear down with divine force.  As you conclude, she shakes her head.

"Then it is exactly as I feared.  This Black Card you awoke with, it is a marker.  You may not be able to remember it, but I suspect you have interacted in some manner with a Daemon already.  The most obvious conclusion is that you made a deal with such a creature.  A great Sin."

She takes a breath, as deep as she could given she wears the same sort of corset as you do.  "We cannot ignore this.  Daemons follow a logic all their own, but if one is watching you we must deal with it directly.  Its hold upon you must be broken, for the good of the Order as much as for your own sake."

She finally releases her hold upon your hands, so that one long finger can tap at her muzzled chin.  "Given our nature, as slaves to the Order, a nightclub would generally prevent our entering.  We will need an escort, a male to overcome the weakness of our femininity."

Diving back into the passing multitudes, you keep close behind Isabella-- although with your leash, she doesn't give much slack.  Your destination proves to be closeby at least, and its familiar too: a bank of Wardrobe devices, provided for travelers looking to change out their laminate before leaving or upon arrival.

Approaching one, Isabella wastes little time in using the exterior panel to make a series of selections.  That she intended them solely for *you* becomes apparent when she rounds on you suddenly, the mirror-like glasses she wore reflecting your own black laminated visage back your way.

"Do you want the Good News... or the Fun News?"

[["Uh... good news?"->IsGood]]

[["Yes... Mistress."->IsWard]]

"Good answer," she grins, her ruby red lips so very bright.  "The *fun* news is that I'm going to be making some additions to your suit.  But the good news, for you at least, is that it will involve that regulation mask coming off.  Lucky you.  Now get in the Wardrobe."

[["Yes... Mistress."->IsWard]]

Still holding your leash with one hand, the Mistress yanks on it suddenly, pulling you closer.  That allows her free hand to strike out, swatting you sharply upon the rear.  Your laminated cheek cracks from the impact, momentarily drawing the attention of several of those nearby.
(set: $IsWard to true)
"I don't need to explain anything to a *slave*," she reprimands.  "I'll remember that, don't you think I won't.  But we will deal with that tonight, after the Club.  For now?  Get in."

[[Testing her patience a second time seems ill-advised.  You get in.->IsWard]]

Wardrobe Devices must generally feature a standardized appearance, at least in Aekora, you conclude as you step in.  Behind the door seals shut, leaving you with the bright white panels lining all six surfaces surrounding you-- and the armatures inevitably hidden beneath.

Instead of lightng up to your presence the interior control surface shifts, the screen going black as red letters appear upon its surface: *slave protocols engaged.*

The restraints emerge afterward, grasping arms seizing your limbs, forcing them to spread as other devices engage.  As promised, the first works free your breath regulating mask-- freeing you from its repressive control of oxygen, allowing you to take your first deep breath in hours.

It proves poorly timed however, as another set of arms slip a medical-like set of braces momentarily between your lips.  You thrash, a natural instict, but they don't proceed further-- instead a padded ring follows in its wake, being seated behind your front teeth.  The braces then pull back, slipping out through the center of the ring, extruding straps that eventually snap into the black laminate of the bondage hood you still wear.

A ring gag, meant to keep your mouth open.  You're so focused on it you hardly notice another long length of laminate extruding itself, however, until slides into the ring.  A phallus, driven into your mouth, nearly threatening to descend your throat.  Again you thrash, trying to bite down, but the ring prevents that-- and a magnetic ring holds the base of the cock firmly to your lips.

[["MMMMMHPH!"->IsWard2]]


:: IsWard2
It's not over yet.  Now gagged, your head is abandoned as the armatures cycle downward.  Starting at your corseted waist they begin printing a new piece of gear upon you, working upward.  The Wardrobe's arms then force your arms down, crossing them beneath your laminated bust.  Sleeves are produced, layering laminate upon laminate, the ends coating your hands but not seperating the fingers-- forming bondage mitts.  Continuing, it leaves your bust exposed, but does run a heavy strap up between your breasts to support the top of the bolero straitjacket in mid-creation.

You emerge a few minutes later, the laminate having been flash-cooled and set.  Isabella awaits eagerly, even pulling her glasses up to inspect your altered outfit more closely.  By her grin, she clearly finds the straitjacket and gags to her tastes.

"Now *there* we are," she postively purrs, taking up your leash again, drawing you in close.  Her hands immediately begin to explore your laminate, the slick material of her own gloves gliding effortlessly across your shoulders.  At your breasts she pauses,(if: $Pierced is true)[ tweaking your pierced nipples with glee, then] fondling your rounded bosom.

Reaching up further her fingers find the base of the cock gag, a bit of effort overcoming the magnets to allowe her to pull it out.  Your saliva follows, clinging to the obsidian phallus before dripping onto your chest.  She reinserts it immediately afterward, smiling again as your brows upturn, struggling to take its length.

"I only thought it proper we fill all *three* of your holes," she notes with amusement.

[["Mmmgh..."->IsWard4]]


:: IsWard4
"It's not even locked on," as if to demonstrate, she pulls the cock out again-- giving you a brief moment's mercy before plunging it between your lips again.  "You just can't do anything about it with that jacket on, can you?"

She doesn't need, nor does she look for an answer.  Instead your cinnamon-scented Mistress merely takes up your leash again, tugging on it to force your following along.  "Come then.  I need to stop and send a message to my other slaves, and then we will make for that address on the Black Card.  A club of some sort, if I recall correctly.

You focus on breathing only through your nose as you follow along.

[[Down, to the terminal.->Terminal]]


:: Terminal3 [INS]
(if: $IsSlave is true)[As your Mistress walks away, you're left in her wake, kneeling beside a line of other slaves, still trying to adjust to what truly amounted to a pair of gags lodged between your lips.  Having every hole filled is truly an intense experience, especially when combined with the straitjacket preventing any real arm movement.  It's a severe enough predicament to ignite a slight burn between your legs, your slickened cunt growing all the wetter as you try to further the sensation.  Bound and leashed as you are, however, that's a losing prospect.

But it's that frustration that momentarily](if: $Nun is true)["...I announce my submission to masculinity openly, and without reservation.  My best use is to be bound and displayed, to be pleasurable on the path of those around me.  I am valuable as a slave, an object to be owned..."

The prayer is repetitive, as such things are, but it makes your position clear-- if your clothing didn't already.  Euphoria departs, leaving you kneeling in line with the other surrounding slaves.  Stealing a look at them, you realize most are looking at you.  If that was due to your prayer, or your ornate regalia isn't clear but it's that glance around that momentarily]  pulls your gaze upward, to those passing by.  In a sea of laminate you spot a woman in offworld textiles, a sure enough sign of an offworlder-- but something further triggers as well.

Clearly she notices your blank stare.  "Uh, hello?  Snap out of it, it's me, Corinth."

"Yeah, I-- wait, what's going on.  You seem like you don't remember me."

Taking Corinth aside, you quickly explain your situation, underlining several times the amnesia you've been struggling with.  Somewhere along the way her expression shifts from the furrowed brown of the concerned, towards something almost empathetic.  

"Gods," she finally concludes, clasping her hands together.  "You poor thing, just look at you.  For a moment I thought you had gone native there.  That's kinda half the reason I came, you know.

Your face flushes with embarrassment(if: $Slave is true)[, although your mask does hide most of it,] as you stammer out the reply.  Corinth at least breaks her stare, looking away as she coughs awkwardly.

Corinth hesitates, her button nose scrunching up as she considers the prospect.  To her credit, it doesn't take her long to come to a conclusion.

"I mean... yeah, let's do it!  I'll try it.  It doesn't hurt, right?  And you know what you're doing, obviously."

Leading her to the bank of Wardrobe machines nearby is easy enough, the local government providing them for those travelers looking to change before departing or after arrival.  Taking a position at the exterior set of controls, you gesture for her to enter as the metallic doors whisk open.  Much as you had back in the hotel, she holds at the brink for a moment, obviously wondering at just how the machine functioned.  But she does eventually step through, your last glimpse of her being her glancing about the tiled interior.

Looking down, you're presented with a number of choices for her first taste of laminate.

[["Let's see here..."->TermWardH]]

You step even closer, arms wrapping around the other woman.  Normally you would have been about the same height, but with your heels you easily have a few inches advantage.  Corinth doesn't flee, but instead openly marvels as she looks up, trying hard not to stare at your laminate chest.

The selection of outfits at your fingertips is, quite simply, astounding.  Unlike the limited mainframe maintained by the hotel, this public machine is far more robust, quite clearly capable of producing most anything you could desire.  Almost all require special privileges however, or DRM keys, or simply large credit purchases.  With Corinth presumably waiting patiently you eventually settle on three particular choices.

The screen displays a pair of models wearing the selected outfit.  To call it *intense* would be a severe understatement, as the warning that follows makes clear:

*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

Accessories are listed as the pictured corset, heels, regulation mask, posture collar, and (non-pictured) inserts.  The corset is noted as featuring 'real steel' boning, and is custom-measured to match standard Torean expectations of functional corsetry.  So too does the posture collar proudly proclaim its core as beein 'real steel', as well as meeting all Aekoran slave law requirements.  The heels are listed as six inches in height, with one inch platforms.  The mask is simply described as rated for Torean storms, as well as regulating oxygen intake.  And the inserts?  Those are described as front and rear installation, custom-molded for maximum stimulation.  All devices feature 10 hour self-release locks.

On one hand it would a terribly strict crash course in Torean culture for Corinth, but on the other... (if: $Slave is true)[you wear the exact same outfit, with all the discomfort-- and pleasure-- that came along with it.]

As you have selected, the Wardrobe has made real.  Gone are Corinth's scratchy textiles, perhaps the easiest means of identifying a tourist on Torei's streets.  She's clothed in pure laminate now, (if: $CorDD is true)[from the perky ribbon set above her cleavage window, to the gap formed between her short skirt and stockings, to the heeled boots that adorn her feet.](if: $CorSec is true)[from the collar of her semi-transparent blue blouse, to the skirt pulled so tightly against her hips, to the heeled pumps adorning her feet.](if: $CorSlave is true)[from the black regulation mask upon her face, to catsuit and corset, down through her towering heeled boots.]

(if: $CorDD is true)[She visibly gawks at her own appearance, modeling for herself once she realizes how readily the laminate allows reflective waves to run across her body.  Hesistant hands follow, growing more confident as she first tests the slick surface, then runs them freedly down her wide hips.

Stepping closer, your arms wrap around Corinth.  She's clearly caught by surprise, meeting your eyes with that same concerned look-- but it breaks as your laminate chest glides against her own, bodies entwining.  She blushes fiercly in response, but holds your gaze.  Despite the public venue, few pay much attention to you-- sensuality often overflowed on Torei.

"I..."  It's all Corinth manages, breathing quickly.

The poor girl clearly struggles to even stand, her heels pushing her posture up and forward, the corset and mask combining to make every breath an effort, and most difficult of all-- the plugs between her legs, crafted to shift and tease with even the barest of movements.

"It feels... everything is just... I *can't*..."  Her hand finds the Wardrobe Device, using it to steady herself as she bends forward, fighting to resist the temptation to press her free hand into the gap between her thighs.  The suit emphasizes her every curve, allowing you to get your first *real* look at her.  Corinth is generally lean, her chest small, although her corset does much to feature them as well as her hips.

Corinth is generally lean, her chest small, although her corset does much to feature them as well as her hips.

Altogether, it's a feeling you know all too well.  That overwhelming sense of lost control, of a dozen different sensations fighting for primacy.  Of being exposed, of being on display, of being so close to *slavery.*

She blushes a bit, trying to adjust the skirt once more before giving up on it.  The red across her cheeks fades.  "You didn't have to say that.  But... thanks.  I mean it."

Her smile seems to underline that point.  "And I guess if you can do it, I can as well.  Any tips?"

[["If it helps, practice your sitting.  Essential with that skirt."->CorSkirt]]

"I noticed that," Corinth huffs, still flustered but calming down.  Her deep breaths only draw attention to the laminate pulled tight across her breasts however, obviously an unintended side effect.

"It didn't even give me *panties*.  And these heels.  I feel like I'm on display for everyone watching."  Reaching up, she pushes her hair out of her eyes, centering herself. It takes a bit, but she manages it. 

"Alright, well-- no going back.  I'm pretty sure that machine like... dissolved my real clothes.  So... how about we get back to why I was looking for you in the first place?"

[["Yeah, why was that?"->TermLook]]


:: CorKiss
Your lips come together, painted and full.  At first Corinth tries to pull away, but quickly she submits-- overwhelmed by so much laminate and raw sexuality.  It's a pose you hold, reveling in the sensation until you finally break-- pulling away with her sweet taste upon your lips.

[[Press against her.->CorPress]]
[[Release her.->CorAway]]


:: CorPress
Your laminated hips surge forward, meeting Corinth's.  Already chest to chest, she isn't given the option to retreat as the smooth expanse of glossy material across your womanhood presses into her own.  (if: $Slave is true)[Your plugs shift readily from the contact, your already wet cunt begging for more.]  Arching your back furthers the effect(if: $Slave is true or $Brand is true)[, but your corset limits that action somewhat].  

Before you can get much further, however, a shiny baton suddenly intercedes.

[[You look to your left.->CorPress2]]


:: CorAway
Breathing deeply, Corinth shakes out her arms, as if that in turn could work out the feelings you had unleashed within her.  (if: $CorDD is true)[Her garters pull sweetly taut with each step, her heels snapping against the floor.](if: $CorSec is true)[Her long legs look quite splendid as the effect of her high heels and short skirt work in unison.]

"Wow," she breathes, collecting herself.  "Any... any tips, for this whole situation, I guess?"

[["Just one: watch your skirt when you sit."->CorSkirt]]


:: CorPress2
<img src="img/KJdQ5QP.png" width="35%" height="35%">

A officer of the Ministry of Truants holds the baton, her laminate uniform gleaming in the terminal's overhead lights.  

"Move along, whores," she instructs, using the baton to push you away from the Wardrobe machines.  "This ain't a spot for loitering, not  unless you're using the slave hitches."
(set: $CorWow to true)
She gestures towards one of the surrounding indents built into the walls, where a number of collared women (and one male) kneel, each leashed to post emerging from the concrete.  Perhaps surprisingly, however, the Officer then moves along-- already honing in on a woman arguing with a slavegirl store attendant further down.

It's the break needed for Corinth to pull away, catching her breath.  Still, she smiles slight, clearly fighting the urge to slip a hand beneath her skirt and finish what you started.

[[Whew.->CorAway]]


:: CorBreath
Corinth does listen, her smoky-shaded eyelids marking closed eyes as she focuses on the simple act of breathing.  (if: $Slave is true)[You know just how much those without a mask took for granted, each of your own breaths only coming with effort.]  She still clearly has a way to go before managing with anything approaching dignity, however, as her pert chest rises and falls with each gasped breath.  Neverthless she manages to finally achieve a semblence of normacy after a bit-- at least as much as one covered from head to toe in black laminate could.

She looks to you.  "How do I get this off?  Can that machine do it?"

[["You're locked in for the next ten hours, there is no taking it off."->CorOff]]
[["Nonsense.  You'll learn to like it, we all do."->CorLove]]

Corinth looks to you, an incredulous expression obvious despite most of her face being covered by the mask.  "Something... something has happened to you.  This planet... You're like one of them now, aren't you?  A glossy *thing* just waiting to be owned."

[["...yes, I think I am."->CorYES]]

Stepping closer, your arms wrap around Corinth.  She's clearly caught by surprise, meeting your eyes (if: $Slave is true)[through her glass viewport to your own] with that same concerned look-- but it breaks as your laminate chest glides against her's, bodies entwining.  She blushes fiercly in response, but holds your gaze.  Despite the public venue, few pay much attention to you-- sensuality often overflowed on Torei.

"I..."  It's all Corinth manages, breathing quickly.

[[Press against her.->CorP2]]
[[Release her.  "Learning to like it yet?  We all do..."->CorLove]]


:: CorOff
"What?!"  Anger rises in her voice as much as her posture, gloved hands curling into fists.  All but faceless and so severely dressed, however, the look is far from intimidating.  "I can't believe... you would do this to me.  Gods!  At least this planet is so remote that no will recognize me... not that they could with this mask, I guess..."

Reaching up, she tries to push her hair out of her eyes, an old habit. Instead she finds only smooth laminate.  She sighs, looking down once more before continuing.  (if: $Slave is true)[You just know she's trying not to touch her own cunt, given how wet your own cunt is.]

So... how about we get back to why I was looking for you in the first place?"

[["Yeah, why was that?"->TermLook]]


:: CorP2
Your glossy bodies pull even closer, Corinth's quiet gasp narrating the gliding embrace of laminate meeting laminate.  Reaching in, your palm slides down her corset before transitioning to the softer flesh below-- and the locked zipper that covered her womanhood.  She moans, (if: $Slave is true)[and your own plugged cunt aches] as you feel the base of her front insert.  

And yet somewhere beneath all that black laminate some sense of dignity reemerges, Corinth pushing you off, taking a step backward.


[["Why did you stop it?"->CorLove]]
[["What are you afraid of, Corinth?"->CorLove]]


:: CorYES
You look to each other for a long time before she reaches up, fingers sliding along the collar pulled tight around her own throat.

A security checkpoint awaits at the terminal's exit.  (if: $Slave is true)[For a moment it looks like you're going to be detained when the Truant Officer working her eyes over your uniform, but you get the sense that Corinth's presence helps smooth things over-- ultimately you're let through with only a warning given to your companion.

"Watch that one, slave-suited freewombs are *always* whores, and they *always* get in trouble."](else:)[Given how many are moving through it, the Truant Officer only gives you and your ID a passing glance.  You get the sense that if either you or Corinth had been dressed in full slave gear, it may have gone quite differently.]

Afterward you emerge not out onto the street (a good thing given curfew), but into one of many connecting corridors between the various buildings that made up downtown.  Pointing out the shuttle system that moved from various points in the city to the Way Up, Corinth waves goodbye.

"I'm going to head to the elevator, wait until the ride comes tonight.  With... everything that has happened, I hope you'll join me.  Be careful."

A security checkpoint awaits at the terminal exit, however, and it is there that you run into trouble.  Upon reaching the uniform Truant Officer manning your particular line, she needs only one look at (if: $Slave is true)[your and] Corinth's uniform to pull you from the line.

"Hey," Corinth complains, stumbling in her new heels.  "I--"

She's answered wit a stun paddle being snapped against her rear, and the Officer's sharp interruption.  "You've been randomly selected for an extra inspection, as a slave.(if: $Slave is true)[ Both of you sluts.]  Up against the wall, hands against it, legs spread, rear up and presented."

Corinth seems liable to complain further, but the Officer preempts her with a gesture of the stun paddle.  The wall in question is between the entrance and exit doors, out of the way but very much visible to everyone coming and going.

Consulting a map nearby, you note a terminal of some sort runs straight to the space elevator compound.  That would have been Corinth's desination, and thus your own.  But in the back of your mind, you cannot shake the siren's call of the Black Card and its promised deal.  You've been through so much, why not make all the bondage and laminate, the pleasure and the pain, worth it?  You still have time, this is your last chance.

You *have* to try.

[[Divert to the Club.->ClubTravel]]


:: ClubTravel
Grand Aekora envelopes you, a city of light and glass-- and so much laminate.  Crowds throng the thoroughfares, nearly everyone cloaked in glossy laminate of a thousand different designs and colors.  Even so, with your growing experience you find it quite easy to pick out the offworlders from those Torean-born or trained.  You end up trying to avoid them, their gawking slowing the passage of those around them almost as much as their stumbling steps-- few seem well-versed in heels.

Your impatience is fueled by a growing sense of Dusk drifting rapidly into night proper, and the Black Card's demand that you make it before the latter.  Still, you reckon you will make it with time to spare.

[[Almost there!->ClubTravel2]]


:: ExitSub
Joining Corinth at the wall, you take the position the Officer demanded-- hands against it, legs spread, back arched to raise and present your rear.  At your side Corinth does much the same, her identical uniform making her your mirror image in submission.  After a moment however your experience shines through, and you notice her legs are hardly *spread*.  They're apart, certainly, but with so many onlookers passing by she's keeping them relatively close together.

[[Get her attention, show her how a slave truly presents herself.->ExitShow]]
[[Let her learn this lesson herself.->ExitLearn]]


:: ExitResis [Debt]
The electrified paddle is deployed against your rear is short order, the pain from the impact almost worst then the shock itself.  Corinth gasps as the Officer slides the paddle between your legs, a clear warning.
(set: $debt to it - 50)
"You just earned yourself a fifty credit fine," she gleefully declares.  "Now get up against that wall, ass out, like the proper collared *slut* I know you are."

[["You can't do this!"->ExitResis2]]
[["Yes ma'am!"  Submit.->ExitSub]]


:: ExitAsk
With great embarrassment, Corinth had been approaching the wall-- but hesitates as the Officer pushing her towards it halts.  She looks to you, then back to the slave-suited Corinth before adjusting her cap slightly.

"No, I suppose you're free to go.  But do you know this slave?  I suppose I can allow you to take her through, if you do."

[["I do know her, and can vouch for her."->ExitVouch]]
[["No, she deserves to be treated like a proper slave."  Let it happen.->TermExitLet]]


:: ExitVouch
The Officer pauses, her deep crimson lips shifting into a frown.  For a moment you think she is going to detain you both anyway, but in the end she looks to the long line behind you growing with every minute and makes her decision.

"I suppose that will have to do," she sighs, checking your ID card before waving a subdued Corinth your way.  "Next time, keep that slut on a leash."

Corinth, still quite mortified, looks to you.

[["Slaves never have it easy on Torei."->TermExitII]]
[["Let's get out of here."->TermExitII]]


:: TermExitII
Emerging from the terminal with Corinth, you step not out onto the street (a good thing given curfew), but into one of many connecting corridors between the various buildings that made up downtown.  Pointing out the shuttle system that moved from various points in the city to the Way Up, Corinth waves goodbye.

"I'm... going to head out, and... try not to... you know, before my elevator ride arrives.  Despite... everything that just happened, I still hope you're there when it comes."

And with that, she departs.

The Officer shrugs and Corinth nearly screams, then transitions into a *clear* scream as she's subjected to the stun paddle once again.  You're given a front row seat to what follows: forced up against the wall, Corinth is made to lift and present her rear.  She's searched thoroughly, the Officer spending plently of time with her hands between her legs, gliding along the smooth black laminate.  In fact she keeps a hand teasing there as she searches elsewhere, then proceeds to question the girl.  By the time she's finally released Corinth is all but begging to cum, a reward the Officer flatly refuses.

Instead she is sent your way with a final slap of the electrifed pattle against her rear, a wink being shared between you and the Truant Officer.  For her part, Corinth seems subdued, not even meeting your gaze as she makes for the door.

Corinth is already up against the wall, taking the position demanded-- which she clearly suggests you mimic, even if she's too afraid to say it out loud.  Meanwhile the Officer needs only to flick the switch on her paddle's handle to punish you, another sharp jolt coursing through your body, this time via both thighs.
(set: $debt to it - 50)
"Only thing worse then a slut is a dumb one," she sneers, forcing you towards the wall.  "That's another fifty credits, and I *won't* ask again."

[["Yes ma'am..."  Submit.->ExitSub]]


:: ExitShow
You catch Corinth's attention when she glances your way, then try to make your point clear without words-- talking would obviously draw the Officer's attention.  Instead you shimmy your rear, bringing your legs together before kicking them out again, spreading wide to present your laminated rear properly.  She catches on quickly, even if she looks down in shame as she mimics your submissive posture.

The sight of your twinned rears, tightly coated in glossy laminate and presented for inspection, clearly pleases the Truant Officer as she approaches.  "Good girls," she all but purrs, before sliding you closer together, hip to hip.  "I'll do you both together, quicker that way.  Your IDs come up as freewombs, but dressed like that... you're just horny sluts, aren't you?  Say it."

:: ExitLearn
The sight of your rear, tightly coated in glossy laminate and presented for inspection, clearly pleases the Truant Officer as she approaches.  Corinth is another story altogether, however, the first chapter of which is started with the use of her shock paddle.  With a snap it connects beneath her rear, finding the tender laminated flesh of her upper thighs.

After that, and a moment's instruction, Corinth spreads properly.  It earns a happy sigh from the Officer.  "Good girls," she all but purrs, before sliding you closer together, hip to hip.  "I'll do you both together, quicker that way.  Your IDs come up as freewombs, but dressed like that... you're just horny sluts, aren't you?  Say it."

Your response is starkly different from Corinth's, and as such you earn different rewards-- she is given a swat from the paddle, this time directed between her legs-- while your corset is landed upon with a hand that moves upward, briefly fondling your chest.

"Liar," the Officer concludes, looking to Corinth.  "But a lucky one.  You are going to be subjected to a search as per Aekoran Slave Code law..."

She slides her paddle into a slot at her waist, the weapon hanging off her belt menacingly.  It frees her hand to slide along your hip, the other hand landing on Corinth.  Moving across your rear she descends the cleft of your cheeks and settles her fingers firmly between your legs.  "...and we will see just what you truly are." 

[[You tremble, the slightest pressure on your cunt plug so very sweet.->ExitPlug]]


:: ExitNo
Your response is much the same as Corinth's, and as such you earn the same reward-- a swat from the paddle, this time directed between your legs.  With them spread the way is clear to the space between your thighs, and this time its the impact that causes far greater discomfort... and a not altogether ignorable level of pleasure.  Your plugs had taken the brunt of it.

"Liars," the Officer concludes.  "But lucky ones.  You are going to be subjected to a search as per Aekoran Slave Code law..."

She slides her paddle into a slot at her waist, the weapon hanging off her belt menacingly.  It frees her hand to slide along your hip, the other hand landing on Corinth.

Her hands tease, but then pull back out, returning to your thighs and rear.  The Officer's fingers are gloved, the opera-length laminate designed for utilitarian purposes as much style, but it makes her touch all the more tantalizing-- laminate gliding against laminate as she explores your body.  At your side Corinth gasps, fighting to maintain her posture as you too fight the urge to reach down and join her exploration of your curves.

All around the crowds continue to move, those queued for the exit check especially well positioned to watch your shared molestation.  Despite the lines the Truant Officer hardly seems to be in a hurry, her examination continuing languidly before she speaks again.

"I want you bent over now," she commands.  "At the waist, although with those corsets you don't have any other option. Hands on your ankles.  Eyes on the floor, legs still spread.  I want a good view of your plugged cunts."

[[Submit.->ExitSubII]]


:: ExitSubII
Like black dolls, in unison you and Corinth take the required pose.  The position makes breathing even harder, (if: $Pierced is true)[and you can feel your pierced nipples being pulled by the shifting of your laminate, ]but you manage.  

It's then the Officer returns her hand to your plugged holes, her thumb pressed against your rear intruder as her other fingers stretch to play with the one in your cunt.  Corinth squeals at your side as the ministrations begin, a slow in and out the Officer provides with clearly demonstrated talent.  Since being installed inside your slave suit your cunt has been wet from the presence of the plugs, and now such direct stimulation drives you towards ecstasy.  The walls of your womanhood *ache* for release, the pressure building as the Officer performs her work.  After a few minutes, with Corinth already squirming, the Officer leans in.

"Getting there, aren't we?  If you want to cum, I want you to turn around, get on your knees, put your hands behind your back-- and tell me you're a wet slut who wants to cum.  Got that?"

At your side, Corinth shivers, but her dignity holds.  She remains standing, and if she can do it why not you?  You have the greater experience.

For a brief moment the terminal goes quiet, and all eyes turn to your panting, black-laminated form.  Seeing just another slave girl announcing her submission, however, only the tourists stare for very long.

The Truant Officer, meanwhile, steps forward.  Her hand finds your head and Corinth's, petting the smooth laminate.  "Ah... there we are, the truth.  Isn't that just *grand?*  (if: $TruCheck is < 10)[And what a hungry, wet slut *you* are in particular."  She smiles down at you.  "Your friend may be quiet inexperienced, but she held out longer.

[[You hold your posture, screaming internally.  You NEED to cum.->ExitCum5]]

Moving to her station, the Officer returns with several bands of red around one wrist.  "Stand," she commands, an order you and Corinth comply with-- if quite reluctantly.  "Raise your foot, one at a time."

In short order, she has slid one band apiece up each of your thighs.  There they cling tightly, a bright break of red amongst the black.  The Ministry of Truant's logo is stamped onto each side, but its the words printed across the front that stand out: on your right thigh: **WET**, and on your left: **SLUT**.

"Something to remember me by," the Officer winks, then pulls forth her paddle.  You're each given one more swat across the rear, this time towards the door.

"Now move along!"

Pausing near the doors, you take a moment to collect yourself.  It's not easy.  Your womanhood still burns with desire, every step fanning those flames.  But your zipper remains locked, and you dare not pleasure yourself openly-- not when so near Truant Officers.  That leaves you with little option but to bear the frustration and indignity, knowing that the words you now wear on your thighs are quite true.

Corinth seems to be working through much the same, still panting as she looks to you through her mask's narrow viewport.

It's the best you can manage at first, with your ring and cock gags thoroughly conspiring to prevent anything approaching actual speech.

And yet, glancing about, the woman sweeps her gaze across the holding area.  For a brief moment you fear she had missed you, but a sharp double take draws her attention back to you-- and your eyes meet.

Maintaining your pose you look down, even if you can't help but watch the woman from the corner of your eye.

It's how you see her pause, perhaps taking in the sights and sounds of a Torean transport terminal in full swing.  Her gaze even passes over the nook you and your fellow slaves are stored in-- only to suddenly snap back your way, meeting your gaze no matter how hard you try and avoid it.

As she approaches, you get a proper look at her.  The lack of laminate upon her body marks her as a tourist quite readily, the bright textiles a far cry from Torei's ubiquitous material.  She's a bit on the shorter side, although most of those surrounding wear heeled footwear, with long hair that's a bit ruffled by travel.

But it's her eyes that pull you in, holding to your own as she comes to stand above.  "My Gods..." she whispers, a hand covering her mouth.  "It *is* you."

Your confusion must have been obvious as she explains.  "It's me-- Corinth."

Your new oral accessories are indeed without locks, instead relying simply on your own utter inability to remove them.  Moving carefully, Corinth's fingers seize upon the base of the cock first.  The magnets give a bit of resistance, but slowly she is able to withdraw the device, sliding it out from your ring gag and out from between your lips.  Your own drool trails afterward, hanging lewdly from your chin.

"Oh Gods, you have a *second* one?" She asks, peering at your o-shaped mouth and the ring installed there.  "Alright... just hang on."

It takes her a second to locate the clasp behind your head, but after a few moments she manages to undo it-- thus pulling away the strap holding it in place, and allowing the ring to be mercifully removed.  Corinth looks at you expectantly as you work your jaw.

"You sound... so happy about it," Corinth replies, looking down at you.  Kneeling, legs spread, straitjacketed and so recently gagged your submission could not be clearer-- but leaning in, she focuses on the small tag hanging from your collar, the writing there making it official.

*Property of Isabella Naram-Sin.*

"Gods," she curses, brushing an errant strand of hair from her eyes.  "Your firm contacted me when you missed several check-ins in a row, paid me to come find you.  Last we heard you were staying at a hotel in the city outskirts, Diarch's Choice?  So I was heading that way, but you're here... *like this.*  A slave."

Despite her incredulity, you detect a spark of curiosity behind her eyes.  "What's it like?"

You resist, again shaking your head as your lips suck on the cock installed between your lips.  You almost *like* the ring keeping your teeth from closing around it.

Cornith however furrows her brows, setting her stance a bit more readily.  "We **need** to talk.  Let me *help you.*"

[[Reluctantly you submit to her will, and hold still.->INSlaveRemove]]

:: INSlaveFight3
Corinth growls.  "You're not getting out of this that easily."

Your bondage, intrusive as it is, does not only allow your Mistress to dominate you at will-- Corinth demonstrates how most anyone can.  Leaning in, she steadies you with a firm grip on your struggling shoulders, then reaches for your mouth.  The magnets give a bit of resistance, but slowly she is able to withdraw the phallic intruder, sliding it out from your ring gag and out from between your lips.  Your own drool trails afterward, hanging lewdly from your chin.

"Oh Gods, you have a *second* one?" She asks, peering at your o-shaped mouth and the ring installed there.  "Alright... just hang on."

It takes her a second to locate the clasp behind your head, but after a few moments she manages to undo it-- thus pulling away the strap holding it in place, and allowing the ring to be mercifully removed.  Releasing you, Corinth steps back to catch her breath-- you at least made every effort to resist her.

But you must have almost gone looking for one... what is there even to like about that?"

"Well... there is not much I can do you for now," she relents, kneeling down to get at your own eye level.  Several passing Toreans look her way, obviously wondering why someone with liberty would quite literally join a slave on the ground.

Corinth takes her image with her all purpose *glass*, sliding it back into a pocket afterward-- but not before holding the image up for you to see.  What had once been a proud, independent prospector is now capture on her knees, legs spread, eyes down.  A slave, waiting for her Mistress to return to collect her.

"I need to get going," Corinth continues.  "I'm... I'm sorry I can't do more for you."

She moves to step away.

Isabella squats down before you, if only to lean in, your own bound form reflected in her mirrored glasses.  "Look at you," she purrs, tapping the base of your cock gag with a gloved finger.

"How is my favorite slut?  You had a *visitor*, didn't you?  (if: $IsGag is true)[A visitor that you were naughty with.

"There, that won't be happening again.  You're locked in now."

She rises, taking your leash from the wall.  "(if: $IsGag is true)[Your punishment for asking for your gag's removal from a stranger will be applied once we get home, but for now?]  We have a club to get to, don't we?  Up now."

She reaches over, plucking the gags from the floor.  "Your punishment for being ungagged now(if: $IsGag is true)[, and for asking for your gag's removal from a stranger] will be applied once we get home, but we must focus on the present.  We have a club to get to, don't we?  Mouth open."

She stares at you for a long moment, then sighs.  "Alright.  It's only right, I guess to... leave you how I found you."
(set: $IsGagged to true)
Taking up the pair of gags, she begins with the ring, carefully placing it between your teeth before securing the strap behind your head.  Unlike Isabella, her work is a bit fumbling, but she persists-- its not like it could really be done wrong, it only takes long.  In short order your mouth is returned to a permanent 'O', your red lips as inviting as they are submissive.  Taking up the secondary component, the phallus, meanwhile causes Corinth to shudder a bit.  "I'm... really sorry about this."

Sliding it in slowly, you nearly choke on it as you did the first time, but the length seems well considered-- enough to be uncomfortable, but not enough to endanger you.  Nevertheless the sensation of the smooth rod being pushed between your lips stokes the fury between your legs, your cunt pressing forward, seeking stimulation.

Corinth notices just as she finishes, the magnetic base snapping to the ring with a click.  Your shameless seeking of attention is met with a mighty blush from the girl, who retreats as quickly as she could.

"There, as promised," she concludes, before backing away.

Approaching the lines leading to the final security checkpoint of the terminal, you join the far longer one required of slaves(if: $IsSlave is true)[ while Isabella is admitted through the express freewomb option].  Many of those beside you are dressed in the pure black laminate of the standardized slave suits, making your own situation stick out quite prominently-- (if: $IsSlave is true)[your lack of a regulating mask having been traded for the set of gags.](if: $Nun is true)[your religious reglia covered in symbols of submission and femininity compared to their featureless attire.]

"That one(if: $Nun is true)[ and that one,]" an Officer manning your line remarks to another further ahead.  Just what she meant is explained moments later, when the officer seizes you by the arm.  "Out of line, slave.  You've been selected for an extended regulatory check."

"No you're not," the Mistress dictates.  Putting your ring gag in first, she follows with the cock, driving it between your waiting lips.  Once it clicks into place, this time she locks it in with a futher tap of her finger.  "But when we get home, you will be.  Up now."

Given the crowds, it takes Corinth only a moment to disappear from your sight, her distinctive offworld textiles lost amidst the sea of passing laminate.  You barely have a few moments to consider her visit, however, before a familiar figure emerges-- in glossy red and black laminate.

"Sister Azalea," Euphoria greets, with a tone perhaps best described as that of a disapproving Mother.  "I see you have been neglecting your prayers?"

Kneeling down and reaching for your chest in one smooth moment, you barely register her intent before she twists hard on one of your pierced nipples, resulting in a pain as immediate as it is sharp.

"I see you will need to reinforcement our prayer frames provide, upon return to the convent."  Several other slaves nearby watch your chastisement.  Euphoria ignores them.  "I will correct you further at a later time, but we *do* have that meeting to make.  Our escort will be meeting us on the other side of the security cordone."

Finally, she releases your chest.

Your eyes drift back down to the laminate slip you had been given, the Order's testament printed neatly upon it.  Before you can make it through more then half dozen lines, however, a black laminate hand lands upon your shoulder.  Looking up reveals red eyes, and the shiny glint of a pierced septum identical to your own.

"Sister Azalea," she greets, with a motherly tone.  "I see you have been diligent in the worship of your own submission."

If she had seen Corinth, no mention is made, the much taller woman instead focusing on the reason for her absence.

"I am certain you will be most pleased to know that I have arranged an escort for us, they should be waiting on the other side of the security cordon for us."

"The traditional sort, Sister," she explains.  "Male, and Torean-born.  Providing escort services to our Order is a common enough display of charity among the local nobility.  We will, of course, demonstrate our submission and thankfulness to him upon entering the Club with his assistance.  It will be good practice for you, and a firm demonstration of our femininity."

Directing you towards the exit, she looks back over her shoulder as an addendum emerges in the form of a question.  "Are you practiced in the art of oral satisfaction?"

"Relatively well filled out," she notes.  "For an offworlder slut."

Her hand then shifts inward, between your legs.  She presses against (if: $IsSlave is true)[the plugs installed there, chuckling as you fail almost immediately to surpress a moan.  "Wet and eager, I see.  A common enough state for girls in suits like that."

Sliding her hands once more down your hips, the Officer finally withdraws her touch.  If you were expecting any fanfare from passing the security check, she gives you little-- instead you're treated to a sharp smack on the rear.

"You have permission to leave.  Move along now, (if: $IsSlave is true)[slave."

"Just in time," Isabella intrudes, striding forward to seize your leash once again, leading you to the door.](if: $Nun is true)[Sisters."  Euphoria bows in response, seizing your leash as she leads you towards the door.]

"The Club your Black Card provided the address for is our next stop," she explains, emerging out into a covered thoroughfare.  This far in the city center, walkways link the various buildings, a clever way to allow paying customers who just so happened to be female to escape the strict terms of curfew.

A tense moment passes, but in the end the Officer slides the stun baton out from between your legs.  "That's right," she intones, hooking the weapon to her belt once more.  "Proper protocol for a slave is that you do not make a *sound* unless I give you leave to."

A gloved hand from Euphoria indicates your escort, a man leaning against the supporting pole of the awning above.  He’s tall, somewhere over six feet, with the broad shoulders and clear musculature of his gender—so rare on Torei.  The full laminate suit he wears only emphasizes that point, the slick glossy material pulled tight across body and face, the later forming a heavy looking gasmask.

“Master Petros owns an estate in the hinterland,” Euphoria says, hands clasped together before her in prayer as much as explanation.  “His family has been one of the leading suppliers of raw laminate to Aekora for decades now.  We of the Order have enjoyed that familial patronage for nearly as long, and his personally for much the same.”

She turns her gaze from the man, back to you.  As always, its hard to hold against the intensity her red pupils could exude.  “It is important to note that Master Petros is a traditionalist and holds women to *very* strict standards.  Slaves such as us even more so.  I would suggest you follow my lead in his presence and remain supremely deferential towards the Master at all times.”

Instead of shock, Euphoria's eyes narrow, giving her motherly demeanor a thoughtful look.  "As a slave, I would not dare to judge the intentions of a freewomb.  Yet I think it best that you mean what you say."

The long sleeves of her robes add a flourish to the way she reaches out, placing a hand on your shoulder.  "This close to the Offworlder's tower, credits are most important.  To be without them is quite dangerous for you, as a woman."

Moving through corriders, you're not greeted with a grand vista of your destination from afar, but instead almost run face-first into an impressive display of neon.  Your address, your destination, is labeled with bold letters: **(colour: "#e619e5")[CLUB LUSH]**.

The doorway is ornate, curling columns framing each side, seemingly rendered in glass or some other manner of transparent material.  Nearby lights enter them only to refract, spilling out in bright patterns.  It's enough to distract you momentarily from a choice that presents itself-- but eventually you focus on your immediate concerns.

Not only is the club ornate, it's guarded by a bouncer, a testament to the Club's wealth demonstrated by the fact that he's male.  To the side a short line awaits, and even a quick glance makes it obvious the clientele trends towards the elite.  The only slaves you see are attending a Mistress or Master.  Getting in that way could be pricey.

The alternative is a sign near the corner of the building, a neon arrow pointing around it and somewhere near the back.  *Entrance By Merit* is all that's given as an explanation.

[[Try the front door.->ClubFront]]
[[I'll try the back door.->ClubBack]]


:: ClubFront
Despite your reservations, you make directly for the line leading to the front door of *Lush*.  The wait takes only moments, the bouncer quickly waving through the handful of patrons before you.  When it comes to your turn, however, he holds up a hand-- while looking you up and down.

(if: $Blue is true)["Looking to get locked into something fun for the night?" He asks, indicating the various cuffs and hardpoints scattered about your blue catsuit.  "You would probably have better luck around back.  Best for slaves and submissives like you."

He shrugs.  "Otherwise, cover charge for freewombs is 100 credits."](if: $Smoke is true)["Good choice on the semi-transparent," he notes, indicating your catsuit.  "Our lights will play across that something fierce.  But perhaps you should try the back door, generally anyone submissive enough to walk around like that isn't going to want to go in this way."

He shrugs.  "Otherwise, cover charge for freewombs is 100 credits."](if: $Sec is true)["Evening ma'am, just get off work?"  He checks your ID, brows rising as he notes the offworlder designation.  "Not from around here then, huh?  My mistake, given the outfit.  Either way, you might want to try the back door.  You're not dressed like a tourist, but they usually enjoy that treatment.

He shrugs.  "Otherwise, cover charge for freewombs is 100 credits."](if: $Brand is true)["I'm sure you're eager to get off those heels, but I can't let you through dressed like that," he explains.  "Girls like you, wearing advert gear like that, I mean.  You need to head around back, try there.  Fair warning: they're going to want to change what's written on your body."

As you turn to go he slaps your ass, laughing as you yelp.

"Watching you go with that corset and heels, though?  I'm almost tempted to break the rules."](if: $Slave is true)["Don't you think for one second you're getting in this way, Slave."  He jerks a hand over his shoulder.  "You need to go the back, see if you can earn a way in that way.  Now get away from my door."

As you turn to go he slaps your ass, laughing as you yelp.

"With a body like that, though?  I'm sure you won't have any problems.(if: $CorSlave is true)[  Especially with those thigh bands.  A *wet slut* indeed!]"]

:: ClubBack
Making your way around the back of *Lush* takes some time, the building proving both surprisingly large and surrounded by smaller storefronts and businesses.  Given the peculiar layout of this portion of the city, with hallway-like interiors encircling each block, it seems possible that any little bit of extra space had been rented out.

Nevertheless you do eventually round a corner to find the club's secondary entrance-- and a line stretching far into the distance.  

[[Shit.  Head for the back of the line.->ClubBack2]]


:: ClubFrontPay [Debt]
"As you wish," the bouncer declares, deducting the 100 credits from your account.  Stepping aside, he reaches above you push open the door.
(set: $debt to it - 100)
"Enjoy your time in *Lush*."

Stepping through the portal, you're greeted with a cacophony of sound and color.  Loud, pounding music thrums through your body as much as the air, matched with the flash of strobes and other lights.  Most of the coloration trends towards violet, adding to the otherwise dim atmosphere-- while reflecting brilliantly off the multitudes in attendance.  

Laminate in a thousand different forms glisten before your eyes, each more elaborate or revealing then the last.  The Club is a hive of activity, all of Torei seemingly condensed into this one place: Mistresses and Masters  attended by slaves, tourists gawking at every passing sight, and spread liberally throughout freewombs and other such independents.  Some are seated at the small tables near the center of the room, awash in the glow of neon, while others crowd the stage up front.  Along the edges booths allow for a more intimate audience, shadows hiding most of what went on there beyond the occasional flash of laminate.

Turning about slowly, you momentarily lose yourself in the madness of sensuality that perhaps best personified Torei.  (if: $Ballet is true)[Your ballet heels put you on as much display as anyone else, the posture required to walk in them pushing your chest out and emphasizing your rear.](if: $Wet is true)[  The bands across your thighs announce you to be part of the festivities, the colors seeming to glow in the violet light, highlighting the white of the words emblazoned there.](if: $Plugs is true)[  Your plugs once again purr to life, as if on cue, inducing a gasp-- and a struggle to prevent your hand from coming down between your legs.]

As if to remind you of your place in it all, Lush gives one last look at your current condition via the mirrors flanking the door.

[[Gaze long into the abyss...->MeetCherishColors]]


:: ClubBack2
Clearly, *Lush* was a popular-- perhaps *the* popular nightclub in Grand Aekora.  You pass all sorts of Toreans on your way to the back of the line, from spritely offworlders wide-eyed and staring at every passing woman (such as yourself), to Torean-born freewombs with slaves held by their leash, and every imaginable sort in between.  What is *missing* however, are men, at least those that clearly did not look like tourists.  Given Torei's proclivities, it's not unreasonable to assume they were allowed immediate access via the front.

Luckily the wait is not as long as you initially feared.  Instead of processing each potential entrant at the door, several women in black laminate move along the line, pulling out hopefuls seemingly at random-- although you note they skip anyone wearing non-laminate, and focus instead on the glossy, gleaming, and beautiful.  

It's not long before one of them taps you on the shoulder.

"Purpose?"  The bouncer looks at you expectantly, a *glass* device held in her hands.  When it becomes clear you don't know what she means, she checks a box on her glass.  "First time, huh?  I'll give you the quick intro: you can wait in this line all night if you like, but we like to keep the party going inside, if you know what I mean.  If you can prove you're worth it, we skip you to the front.  So: what's your purpose?"

She looks down, picking a few relevent options from the list.  "Business?  Pleasure?  (if: $Slave is true or $Blue is true)[ Hmm... with that collar, perhaps you're a slave?  Having a Master within doesn't exempt you.]"

"Wonderful,(if: $Sec is true)[and not unexpected, with that outfit,]" she notes, making a note on her *glass.*  It's the last notation she makes before turning her attention on you more fully, her eyes running up and down your body in a look of clear appraisal.

"Alright, yout want in?  You're almost there, with that  outfit.  Just need a bit more.  I've got choices for you."

[["Choices?"->ClubBackChoice]]

She smiles.  "Of course you are.(if: $Smoke is true)[  Why else does someone wear transparent laminate?]  Luckily, that's our specialty." She makes one more note on her glass, before turning her attention on you more fully, her eyes running up and down your body in a look of clear appraisal.

She holds a finger to her lips, thoughtful for a moment.

The employee points to a billboard across the thoroughfare.  A model in pink laminate lounges seductively, looking directly at the camera.  Apparently it was an advertisement of some sort for a cosmetic company, demonstrating it's wares in a very Torean style-- but your eyes are drawn to her boots.

"Ballet heels," the employee explains.  We'll match them to your current outfit, of course, but you will be on your toes-- quite literally for the rest of the night.  They are *not* comfortable until you really get a chance to get used to them, but they are fun.  Agree to wear a pair, and you will be inside *Lush* in no time."

It's a promise kept in short order, although you're too far away from the door to truly observe from the slave anything more then a flash of blue and a scandalously short skirt.  But your attendent returns to your side afterward, a band each stretched between the fingers of her hands.

"Leg up, one at a time."

Sliding them into place proves easy at first, but grows progressively harder-- by the time she seats them properly upon your upper thigh they're quite tight.  "There we go!  Follow me."

She leads you out of the line and towards the front door as you look down, staring at the laminate bands now encircling each thigh.  They're red, the lettering as bold as it is white-- **FUCK** on one, **TOY** on the other.  It's hard not to blush just thinking about wearing them in public, and harder still when you notice several of those in the line you're passing staring at the additions to your wardrobe.

(set: $Ballet to true)
It's a promise kept in short order, although you're too far away from the door to truly observe from the slave anything more then a flash of blue and a scandalously short skirt.  Your attendent returns soon after, holding up the boots for your observation.  The heels are *staggering*, the design clearly intended to quite literally keep you on your toes.  Matched to your laminate's color, they appear intended to rise to your mid-calf and are topped along the uppermost rim with a locking band that would prevent access to the lacing once put into place.  Motionioning for you to sit down, she slides them onto your feet with the practiced hands only Torean experience could provide.  "There we are."

Afterward she leads you out of the line and towards the front door as you try to adapt to the strict footwear.  Even standing still requires a demonstration of balance, while walking leaves you wobbly and teetering.  The attendant pauses to give you some time to practice, and eventually you *do* manage to not embarrass yourself.

The attendant that had guided you this far flicks open a device, perhaps six inches long.  Almost like a baton, one side glows with a violet light edging towards white.

"We need to change your suit adverts," she explains.  "As I mentioned.  Lush has a reputation for maintaining a certain sort of class.  If you're going to advertise anything, it's going to be *our* services.  This device here is a mobile laminate printer, enough for our purposes.  I'll just need you to spread your legs, and hold your arms out to the sides."

The held finger descends, to be met immediately by a purr between your legs.  Your hips twitch of their own accord, the laminate intruders installed there dancing to life.  Still standing in line, you try to bite down on the moan that rises to your lips, but its a losing effort.  It feels so *good*, even when emanating from the device up your ass.  So good, in fact, a wave of disappointment rises when they suddenly cease working.

"I see you like it," the attendent muses, with a knowing look.  "Their activation is semi-randomized, and intended to tease.  Most girls don't get an orgasm out of it... but you *will* be nice and wet.  Now come on, let's head up to the front.  You earned it."

To your surprise, the first application brings a bit of a shock-- as if the skin beneath the laminate on your thigh that she had started at was being pricked by a pin.

"Sorry about that," the attendant says, noticing your discomfort.  "Probably should have mentioned that.  Wardrobe technology is damn near perfect, but once it gets this small some sacrifices towards the experience are made.  I promise it won't hurt *too* bad."

It's more of an annoyance then proper pain, she's right about that.  At least it goes quickly, the device being passed over each branded portion of your catsuit.  Thighs, arms, chest, back-- by the end the suit itself remains the same, but the designs imprinted upon it have changed.

And *designs* are perhaps the best descriptor.  Instead of words, most of the alterations are variations on the same swirling logo, the same painted on the door before you.  Only on your back and flanks are the words CLUB LUSH emblazoned boldly, the color a light purple to contrast sharply against the otherwise black hue of your suit.

"See?"  The attendant asks, snapping the handheld device back together.  "Easy, right?"

The bouncer opens the door as she waves you towards it.

With each breath you draw in through cherry red lips, your (if: $Pierced is true)[pierced ]chest is on clear display.](if: $Brand is true)[The black of your catsuit drinks in the violet ambience of the room as readily as the similarly colored logos for the Club seem to glow in response to the light.

"**Breathtaking**, right?"

It's only then, the words spoken over your shoulder, that you notice a woman had stepped up behind you.  Turning to regard her, you see that she is uniformed-- in tight laminate.  Surrounded by the violet hues of the club, her servant's livery matches nicely in it's light shade of blue, being tight across her chest before expanding to a very short skirt.  Just how short it is she demonstrates by lifting it for you while bowing.  (if: $PlayE is true)[You recognize it from your time with Isabella as a very well practiced Torean reverence.](else:)[A Torean curtsy, of some sort, you reckon.]

"I saw you observing yourself in the mirror," she explains, smoothing out her skirt and petticoats, "and I just had to say it, Mistress.  You wear laminate well.  Ah, but where are my manners?  Allow me to welcome you to Club Lush, my name is Cherish.  As a slave of this establishment, please allow me to service you in whatever manner you deem me capable of."

Her collar is thin, pulled tight against her throat, fashionable-- and without an observable way for it to be removed.

[["Services?"->CherishServices]]


:: CherishServices
"First time at Lush?"  She winks.  "No problem, Mistress.  Let me run you through the various services we offer here, alright?"

She steps more directly to your side, allowing her white gloved hand to be more easily followed as she uses it to direct your gaze.  "Most of our guests start at the bar, which is fully stocked with a range of drinks-- both alcoholic and otherwise-- sourced from all over Torei, as well as a selection imported from the Offworlders.  Or if you like, you may take a seat at a table or booth.  Built into each is a button you can use to call the nearest available slave at your convenience, as well as to reward or punish us as you deem necessary."

Just what *that* meant isn't clear, as Cherish turns you towards the mouth of a hallway that disappears into darkness-- a bright pink neon sign above shaped like a pillow.  "We also provide several private rooms, outfitted with lounging areas and bed, rented by the hour.  Many freewombs utilize them to solicit their betters, but for the right price you can also rent me-- or any of the other slaves in-uniform for the night, if you like."  Another wink.  "Restraints included, of course."

Finally she casts her attention upward, to the second story balcony overlooking the stage.  "And that would be our VIP area.  Invitations are *quite* hard for most to come by, but if you do acquire one you need only speak with Charon at the elevator."

She seems to mean the obsidian-skinned male standing with crossed arms before the door.

[["Actually, I think I'm supposed to meet someone here."->Cherish3]]


:: Cherish3
"Ah, of course!  If you would provide your identification card, I can check to see where your party is waiting?  I just need to stop at the bar, I will be right back."

Taking your card, Cherish moves just as indicated, allowing you to watch her go.  Her swaying hips shift her skirt just *so*, revealing the triple hints of white that are her panties, petticoats, and garters.  At her return, however, you sense an incoming problem.

"Mistress," she begins, "the good news is that we did have your name on record.  Your party is waiting in our VIP Suite #4... but they did not provide authorization for you to ascend, and have an outstanding do-not-disturb order."

[["So I can't just go up?"->Cherish4]]
[["What does that mean?"->Cherish4]]


:: Cherish4
"My apologies, Mistress, but we cannot allow a freewomb access to our VIP area without you being cleared by an existing VIP member, and as I said your party asked to not be disturbed.  You could always wait to see if they emerge or rescind that order, however?"

You have no idea how long that could take, and the Black Card had been quite clear: *dusk*.  You don't have that sort of time.  Perhaps your expression (if: $Slave is true)[despite your mask] gives that away, as Cherish speaks up again.

"Alternatively..." she adjusts her glasses, Torean biomedical prowess meaning they *had* to just be for decoration.  "...you could perhaps seek authorization from one of our VIP members still down here, in the common area?"

She first indicates a woman seated primly at one of the private booths.  Alone, she would have been obscured by the shadows there were it not for the bright holographic image displayed before her-- although you're too far away to make out what it depicted.  "Mistress Tysus Sargon, of House Sargon.  She is a scholar, as I understand it, but more importantly to your purposes a member of House Sargon-- one of the two ruling families of Aekora, and a VIP member.  Or..."

Cherish shifts your attention to a man at the bar, a rounded gas mask obscuring his features.  "Master Petros.  I am not certain if that is his first name, or last... he is *quite* mysterious.  But he is a VIP member as well."

[["Only the two options?  Does no one else go upstairs?"->Cherish5]]


:: Cherish5
Cherish blinks.  "Well no, no one else-- excepting uniformed slaves like myself, Mistress.  We of course serve the VIP lounge just as readily as we do those on the floor down here.  But that's not an option for you, of course."

*Or is it?  Glancing around, you notice occasional traffic in women dressed like Cherish from a side door near the stage.  Sneaking in there would be the most dangerous option, of course, but perhaps a back path led upstairs-- or at the very least you could find a Wardrobe machine that could produce you a uniform like those the Club's slaves wore.  Then you could simply pass right by that imposing looking bouncer...*

[[Hmm...->Cherish6]]


:: Cherish6
Lost in momentary thought, you're startled out of it by a sudden jolt of movement from Cherish.  Her cheeks flushed, the slave shifts her attention to look around at the tables nearby.

"My apologies Mistress, but someone nearby just summoned me.  I will need to service them, but I'm sure you need some time to consider your options?"  She indicates the nearest table, one of the taller ones beneath the bright lights of the Club proper.  At it's center is a small control console, with several prominent buttons.  "If you need me again, please do not hesitate to utilize the call function every table has.  Oh-- and a tab has been opened for you, if you run out of credits.  Obviously, consider the unfortunate circumstances that can come with being a freewomb in debt, though."

Again she lifts her skirt and bows, a farewell that she holds for a full step as she backs away-- and then makes her way towards one of the private booths along the wall.

You move to the table Cherish had pointed out, leaning an elbow on the high top as you consider your options.

[[Choices, choices...->LushHub]]


:: LushHub
<img src="img/DZBI1bG.png" width="80%" height="80%">

All around you, Lush seethes with activity.  Slaves, Masters, and everything in between, a heady cocktail you can barely process over the underlying thrum of pounding music and the hum of a hundred different private discussions.

You have: (print: $debt) credits.

:: CherishGreet
It takes a few moments, but in response to your button press you soon notice Cherish breaking away from one of the private booths to approach your own table.  Despite the tall platforms of her heels she moves through the crowds milling about Lush with a subtle amount of grace.  Coming up alongside you, she bows her head in greeting.

[["Hello Cherish."->CherishHub]]


:: BarGreet
Weaving through the tables and crowds, you approach the bar.  A long countertop greets you, the bottom portion darker colored, the top itself translucent.  Lacking stools or chairs of any sort, it's nevertheless busy-- it takes some time for the bartender to approach you.

He's both male and uncollared, a bit of a surprise given your knowledge thus far of Torean culture-- service industries seemed reserved for slaves, and they were almost always women.  Whatever the case may be, he seems quite comfortable with the work, pouring glasses with a dexterity that matches the jovial way he speaks with several nearby patrons.
(set: $BarGreet to true)
[[Wave him over.->BarHub]]


:: Order Drink
The control console built into your table has several buttons as well as a small screen.  Choosing the option for *drinks* brings up a new menu, a staggering variety of options being presented.  Given your memory, most are entirely foreign to you-- but you do get the vague sense that a few are from offworld.  Lush clearly was well served, when it came to alcohol.

(if: $Slave is true)[Unfortunately your breath regulating mask makes drinking impossible.  While the thought of a cold beverage certainly appeals, especially given the stricture of your full enclosure, your outfit utterly denies you.](else:)[[[Try the stout, a drink you think is from offworld.

[[One of them is called Lash.  Try that. (15 Credits)->TableLash]]
(if: $DrinkC is false)[[[Try the most expensive one.  Daemon's Blood. (50 credits)->TableDaemon]]]]
[[Turn away from the drink console.->LushHub]]


:: SargonGreet
(set: $SargonMeet to true)Moving away from your table, you cross the crowded floor of the club, making for the far wall and the far more private booths arrayed along it.  (if: $Wet is true)[With each step you cannot help but notice the occassional clubgoer staring overlong at your glossy thighs, the salacious words emblazoned upon them earning you a good bit of attention if little else.]  (if: $Ballet is true)[Even across such a short distance the severity of your heels make themselves known, the carefully measured gait you had adopted somewhat upset by the crowd constantly milling around you.]  (if: $Plugs is true)[Every step brings you closer to Tysus, but it also shifts the plugs buried between your legs.  Given the way they're sealed inside you, reaching down to adjust the circumstances of your torture seems to be almost a worse fate then simply letting them be-- focusing instead on trying not to pant too noticably.]

Soon enough your intended destination comes into view.

[[Keep moving.->SargonGreet2]]


:: PetrosGreet
Since you had glimpsed him at the bar upon arrival, the mysterious Master Petros had moved.  Searching Lush's ground floor you find him furthest from the stage, slowly swirling a half-empty shot glass while seated on a large, low-slung cyan couch.  

As you make your way towards him, however, a hand reaches out to grab your arm.  (if: $DrinkB is true)[It's the woman you had met at the bar, Kell.  Much like yourself, her pupils are still circled in a thin glowing line of violet.](else:)[She doesn't look particularly familiar, but you notice her pupils are ringed in a violet glow.]

"Be careful with that one," she warns.  "Very... strict, with freewombs.  I wouldn't approach him unless you're really ready for it.  Petros doesn't give second chances, and he expects absolute submission from women."

[["Thanks for the warning."->PetrosGreet2]]


:: BackroomGreet
Picking your way across the crowded central floor, you eventually make your way to the stage, and then to the side of it.  Here the tables thin out until ending altogether in a short expanse before a door very clearly labeled **LUSH STAFF ONLY**.

The serving girl Cherish's mention of uniformed slaves like her being allowed free access to the VIP area had inspired you to approach, and you had indeed seen several of the powder-blue clad women make their way past the imposing bouncer at the VIP stairs.  But attempting something like that would be at the very least quite frowned upon by the Club's staff if you were caught, and knowing Torei's laws regarding your gender would probably be blatantly illegal.  Yet your conviction remains strong: you *must* find a way to reach that VIP suite, to make that deal that brought you to Torei in the first place.

Either way, making an attempt would likely be committing fully to this plan and abandoning other potential opportunities.

[[I want to consider my other options.  Turn back for now.->LushHub]]
[[You're set on doing this.  Make for the door.->BR2]]


:: VIPGreet
Crossing the Club's central floor, you make for the staircase underneath the VIP balcony above-- and its imposing guardian.  Even from afar the man appears massive, a fact confirmed with every step that draws you closer to him.  Undoubtedly somewhere far over six feet tall, his skin is a distinctive ebony, his outfit a stylish laminate evening coat with the sleeves rolled up to reveal heavy muscled arms underneath.

Nevertheless his tone is soft as he holds out a hand, at your approach.  "VIPs only, love.  And while I don't mean to offend, I can usually tell who fits that bill."

Despite everything, for once Torei's nature doesn't overshadow an interaction.  The bartender's greeting is much the same as it would be anywhere else in the galaxy.

(if: $Slave is true)["Sorry babe," he replies, in an easy going manner.  You wouldn't be walking around freely in here with that oufit if you were a full slave, so you pass that test, but the simple fact is that your mask doesn't really seem to allow *drinking*, alright?"

He shrugs.  "Shame, too.  I've got a drink that would really make your plugs fun."](else:)["Sure, sure," he replies.  "I've got pretty much everything you could imagine, but let me suggest a few of the popular ones tonight?  If you're looking for a taste of the galaxy beyond, we just got in a terrific stout.

(if: $DrinkC is true)[Kamn right I am, I can-- quite literally-- see it in your eyes.]  Well in that case, I do have one other option... something you won't find outside of Torei.  We call it *Daemon Blood.*  Gotta try it to believe it, ain't that right, Kell?"

He had turned towards another woman at your side, an empty shot glass held in her hand.  Her lips are parted, her eyelids low, sultry and inviting.  And her eyes, pupils naturally brown, are ringed by violet.  She smiles.]

:: BarStout [Debt]
He pours you a glass from tap, the drink as dark and thick as promised.  Taking a sip, you lean an elbow against the bar, enjoying your taste of the galaxy beyond Torei.  It's a reminder that something else did exist beyond the laminate and bondage, the slavery and inequality that reigned throughout the planet.  But is that galaxy amongst the stars what you even desire anymore?
(set: $debt to it - 10)

[[It is.  Finish your drink.->BarHub]]
[[You are no longer sure.->BarHub]]
[[No.  Leave the drink unfinished.->BarHub]]


:: BarLash [Debt]
"Now that's a drink for a Torean girl," the bartender exclaims, retreating to the shelf behind him.  He returns with a pure black bottle, pouring you a small amount.  The drink is clear, but even a whiff seems to tickle your senses.  Strong stuff indeed.  Nevertheless you throw it back, the *Lash* burning as it makes its way down your throat.
(set: $debt to it - 15)
"I wouldn't do too many of those," the bartender advises, retaking your glass.  "A freewomb like you could get in trouble, taking too many Lashes, if you know what I mean."

The bartender's easy going smile widens.  "Now *that* is a good choice."
(set: $debt to it - 50)
He moves to the shelves behind him, reaching up to take a small bottle from the top shelf.  As he unscrews the top, you notice the bottle's neck has a small decorative collar around it.  A shot glass is then filled, the liquid a pure, almost oily black.

The shot glass is small, making it a single swallow.  It's not even half bad, a bit... slimey, but strangely devoid of flavor.  Unlike most alcohol, it doesn't even burn going down.

The bartender leans forward slightly.  "Feeling it yet?"

"It's not *actually* the blood of a Daemon," he says, holding a straight face for a long moment.  The smile comes eventually however, two fingers held out to indicate the shot glass.

"But it is a gift from our friends at the poles.  One must wonder what they use the stuff for, hmm?"

He nudges the glass, expectantly.

[[Drink it.->BarDaemonDrink]]


:: BarDaemonDrink2
Whatever you had intended comes out as a wanton moan, the surprise of it shocking you-- although the bartender at your side seems to have anticipated it.  

"I wouldn't recommend walking for a few minutes," he advises, the reason why becoming apparent as the Daemon's Blood makes itself felt.  Your every nerve seems to momentarily spike, goosebumps emerging across your skin, before the sensation pulls back-- only remaining strong at certain erogenous points.  Your lips, your breasts, the space between your legs.  It's like small fires had been lit there, burning with a sudden, fierce desire.

You cross your legs, laminated thighs rubbing together.  (if: $Wet is true)[The bright words on your thigh bands suddenly announce a very clear truth, your cunt wet and hungry.]  (if: $Ballet is true)[As the bartender had warned, walking does suddenly seem out of reach-- merely standing in your ballet heels proves nearly impossible, your thighs rubbing greedily together as best they can.]  (if: $Plugs is true)[Worst of all, you can feel your womanhood aching, the plugs installed between your legs having already worked you into a sensual heat.  The urge to run your hand down, to masturbate as best you could, is nearly impossible to ignore.]

At your side, the woman named Kell looks to you.  Her lidded eyes are still ringed in violet, her lips pulled into a languid smile.

"Your eyes..."

The reflection of the bar reveals your own pupils circled in violet.

[[Try to clear your head.->BarDaemonTempt1]]

"The first hit is the strongest," the bartender chuckles as you close your eyes, trying to regain your self control.  "It will pass shortly."

At your side, however, Kell leans in.  You crack an eye, only to see what she is doing, but you cannot help but notice the way her cerulean catsuit gleams wonderfully, pulled tight across her chest and waist.  

"It's not nearly as fun if you resist it..."

[[Close your eyes.  Focus.->BarDaemonPass]]
[[Let it take you.->BarDaemonGo]]

You let go, your body almost acting of its own accord.  Turning to Kell, who seems to brighten, recognizing your intent, you embrace.  Glossy laminate glides across your arms and legs as you entwine, breast-to breast.  Looking into her eyes, the Daemon's Blood in her eyes, you hardly notice several onlookers nearby watching.

"The fun little violet in your eyes will last a few hours," the bartender explains, as you try to calm your body down.  It's surprisingly difficult(if: $Plugs is true)[ ,your plugs undoubtedly not helping].  "Everything else will pass pretty quickly.  Hell of a drink though, huh?"

When you finally do manage something approaching self control, you open your eyes, revealing Kell to be absent and the bartender reaching over to take your shot glass back.  (if: $Sec is true)[Only belatedly do you reach down, pulling your skirt back down.](if: $Slave is true or $Brand is true)[You take one last deep breath, your corset making it a bit of an effort.](if: $Blue is true or $Smoke is true)[You take one last deep breath, the  laminate of your catsuit pulling all the tighter across your chest.]

Further down your hips seem to shift of your own accord, (if: $Sec is true)[a hand hiking up your skirt ]as you press your womanhood into her thigh(if: $Plugs is true)[, driving your plugs deeper into your cunt.]  Grinding into her, you both arch your backs in unison, pressing your breasts forward as the ecstasy builds.

[["Mmmmgh..."->BarDaemonGo3]]


:: BarDaemonGo3
Somewhere, seemingly far away, the bartender intervenes.  "Now, girls-- I would remiss if I did not make it clear that going much further would require a private room..."

The kiss is broken as Kell pulls back, looking at you curiously.

[["Give me the room."->BarDaemonGo4]]
[["We... we should end here."->BarDaemonGo4]]


:: BarDaemonGo4
Kell regards you for a moment, her violet-encircled gaze still so entrancing, but in the end she pulls back-- breaking your embrace.

"Better not," she concludes, tone still sultry.  Looking you over, she gives an impish shrug.  "You're fun, but I came her to make some credits tonight.  Won't make anything running Blood with another freewomb, sweet as she is."

(if: $Wet is true and $CorSlave is true)[She winks, nodding at your thigh bands.  "Even if she is a *Wet Slut.*"](if: $Wet is true and $CorSlave is false)[She winks, nodding at your thigh bands.  "Even if she is a *Fuck Toy.*"]

"My favorite topic," he grins, spreading his arms wide.  "Lush is *the* premiere night club in the Ringdom, deep in the heart of our capital, Grand Aekora.  We're close enough to the Way Up, and the tram that runs directly there from here, to be easily reached by tourists-- but far enough away for them to get a proper taste of Torean culture.  Yet we're popular with the Torean-born as well, including the local nobility.  Both Naram-Sin and Sargon are frequent visitors."

He certainly does a good job of selling the establishment's features.

[["Very interesting."->BarQ]]
[["Are all the staff enslaved?"->AskBar2]]


:: AskTender
"Myself?" He looks down, as if noticing his own presence for the first time.  "I fear there is not much to tell.  Hmm... I suppose I can say that I do enjoy bartending, even if I do not get to do so regularly.  Obligations being what they are."

[["I see."->BarQ]]


:: AskTysus
"Ahh," the bartender muses, looking towards the nook where the Mistress in question remained seated.  "A member of House Sargon, as the name would suggest.  Our Ringdom is ruled by a Diarchy, one each from the Sargons and Naram-Sin.  But that one is a scholar, not a politican.  Quite sharp, or so I've heard.  Although her area of study is known for being particularly difficult."

He leans in over the table, the light emanating from the bar itself momentarily casting his eyes in shadow.  "Daemons.  Emissaries from the ancient AIs at the poles.  Makes me wonder just what she's doing *here*, though.  Lush isn't exactly a quiet place of study."

[["Interesting."->BarQ]]


:: AskPetros
"An enigma, by all accounts," the bartender replies, a hand on his chin as if in thought.  "But quite wealthy.  Hmm... and I suppose I can tell you that he is quite the traditionalist. If you were to seek his favor, as a freewomb, I would recommend approaching him with as much grace and submission as you can muster.  I have noticed he rarely gives time to any girl not already in a collar."

[["Something to keep in mind.->BarQ]]


:: AskBar2
"Of course," he replies readily.  "Or at least that applies to the female staff within the building itself.  You may have noticed our building is quite large?  The back quarter is their living quarters.  And we have of course acquired them from Grand Aekora's own slave markets, their service here demonstrating in turn the value that can be found at this Ringdom's Prime Markets."

He glances up, at the balcony looming above.  "Well of course I do.  Purchase a VIP membership, or be invited by a VIP member.  But... I suspect neither course is open to you?  Well-- in that case I'm afraid I cannot be of much help.  Lush makes a point of maintaining the exclusivity and privacy of our VIP area, and we cannot make exceptions."

[["I understand."->BarQ]]

"Ah, yes.  You are the one with the message from Suite #4?  A strange situation, I must admit.  One of our VIP members rented the Suite just before you arrived."

[["I see, can I ask another question?"->BarQ]]
[["Strange?  What makes that strange?"->AskVIPEmpty]]
[["Who made the reservation?"->AskVIPWho]]


:: AskVIPEmpty
"Well, its just that are suites are for... particular activities.  One generally requiring a partner, or three."

He winks.  "But our VIP member arrived only with a rather large suitcase.  Thus the strangeness.  We are not a hotel, and he is a local-- I don't see any traveling in the cards."

[["I see, can I ask another question?"->BarQ]]
[["Who made the reservation?"->AskVIPWho]]


:: AskVIPWho
"That... I am not at liberty to say."  The bartender shrugs.  "But given the slight strangeness of the circumstances, I can at least tell you that he is a regular member in good standing with Lush.  If I see him come down into the lower area of the Club, I will of course have one of the serving girls tell him of your being here."

:: AskVIPCost
"Yearly memberships are most common, but I get the sense that you are looking for something far more temporary?  The cost for a daily access pass is 500 credits."

He looks to you, a bit apologetic.  "For free males, that is.  I'm sure you understand that given the rarity of my gender, and our usual wealth, concessions are made to their pleasure.  As a freewomb, access to our privileged areas would cost you 700 credits."

He points across the floor of Lush, to the ebon-skinned man near the stairs.  "Talk to Charon if you would like to buy a pass, or one of our current VIP members grants you access.

Only a few minutes pass between your confirmation of the order, and the approach of Cherish, a small tray holding your drink in her hand.  Coming up alongside your table, she sets the stout before you with a smile.  The glass is large, the beverage within dark and frothy.

:: TableDaemon
Only a few minutes pass between your confirmation of the order, and the approach of Cherish, a small tray holding your drink in her hand.  Coming up alongside your table, she sets the Daemon's Blood before you with a smile.  It's a shot glass, the liquid inside oily, and pure black. 
(set: $debt to it - 50)
Holding the tray to her chest, Cherish curtsies smartly.  "As requested, Mistress.  Your account has been charged fifteen credits.  (if: $DrinkB is true)[Judging by your eyes, I see you have already experienced Daemon's Blood.  Good, I will not provide the disclaimer.  You know *exactly* what you're getting into.](if: $DrinkB is false)[Although I must warn you, Mistress, regarding this particular drink.  It has effects both immediate and long lasting.]"

(if: $DrinkB is false)[[["What sort of effects?"->TableDaemonAsk]]]


:: TableStout2
The stout is perhaps best described as *thick*, as if you were eating liquified bread.  As such it's quite filling, the taste lingering on your tongue as you eventually finish.  Given the size of the glass, you're thankful your lipstick was quite impermeable.

Cherish reaches in to retrieve your glass as you notice the console in your table lighting up.  Two options are made available.

[[Option 1: Reward for good service.->TableReward]]
[[Option 2: Punish for poor service.->TablePunish]]
[[Choose neither, and let Cherish leave.->LushHub]]


:: TableReward
You select the reward option, and are immediately greeted with a slight hum emanating from somewhere beneath Cherish's skirt.  Her brows upturn in response, a hand moving to shift her glasses back up on her nose as she clearly fights a desire to reach down between her legs.

"I am glad you are pleased, Mistress," the slave all but purrs, collecting herself as the hum ceases.  "Was there any other service I could provide at this time?"

[["No, slave.  Leave me."->TableRewardMean]]
[["No, you've been a good girl.  You may leave."->TableRewardGood]]
[["Is your cunt plugged, Cherish?"->TableRewardAsk]]


:: TablePunish
You select the punish option, and are immediately rewarded by Cherish going ramrod straight.  A whimper slips from between her lips as she looks down, trying very hard not to make a scene.  Whatever you had inflicted upon her passes soon enough, however, and she is quickly apologetic.

"I am most ashamed you were not pleased with my service, Mistress.  Please, is there anything I can do to make it up to you?"

[["Be quicker next time, Slave.  Now leave me."->TableRewardMean]]
[["What did I just do to you?"->TablePunishAsk]]
[["Come closer."->TablePunishCloser]]


:: TableLash2
Living up to its name, the Lash is quick and sharp, snapping down your throat as you drink it down.  The burn that follows indicates a heady amount of alcohol within.  You're not sure if your desire for more is a result of the alcohol, or the pain.

Cherish reaches in to retrieve your glass as you notice the console in your table lighting up.  Two options are made available.

[[Option 1: Reward for good service.->TableReward]]
[[Option 2: Punish for poor service.->TablePunish]]
[[Choose neither, and let Cherish leave.->LushHub]]


:: TableRewardMean
Your sharp tone serves its purpose, and Cherish is quick to retreat, taking her tray and your glass with her.  Meanwhile you lean back, looking about Lush for your next move.  

[[Still, the drink was good.->LushHub]]


:: TableRewardGood
With the tray and your glass held in one hand, Cherish performs a half-reverence, using her free hand to lift the front of her skirt for your observence.  The panties beneath are bright white.

"Thank you, Mistress.  I will leave you to your considerations.  But please, if you need anything else, do not hesitate to call me."

[[You watch her go, considering your next move.->LushHub]]


:: TableRewardAsk
Only on Torei could you find a slave like Cherish who responds without hesitation.  "I am not, Mistress.  But I have been fitted with a clit piercing, as all slaves at Lush are.  It has functions allowing for both reward and punishment, as you have seen."

[[You watch her go, considering your next move.->LushHub]]

Her brows are still upturned, indicating her discomfort, but the slave does answer immediately.  "A shock to my clit, Mistress.  As correction... for whatever it is you deemed me to be lacking in.  All of Lush's slaves are fitted with piercings that provide such functionality.  Your pleasure is important to us.  Was there... anything else I could do for you?"

[["Be quicker next time, Slave.  Now leave me."->TableRewardMean]]
[["Come closer."->TablePunishCloser]]

Cherish steps closer, looking a bit concerned.  Her powder blue uniform remains just as tight and glossy as when you first saw it, upon entering.

[[Slap her ass, then let her go.->TablePunishSlap]]
[[Feel her chest, then let her go.->TablePunishGrop]]


:: TablePunishSlap
Her skirt barely provides coverage for her rear, allowing you to easily slap it sharply.  She moans softly, but keeps her hands collected before her, holding tray and glass steady as she looks for leave to go.  Once given Cherish is quick to retreat, the pale flesh of her rear cheek visibly reddened.  Meanwhile you lean back, looking about Lush for your next move.  

[[Still, the drink was good.->LushHub]]


:: TablePunishGrop
Reaching up you find her pert breasts, the laminate pulled tight across them warm to the touch.  Quickly you notice she's pierced at each nipple, the half-rings embedded in each clearly distinct to your touch.  

Instead of resisting in any way to your groping, she remains still-- holding her tray and your used glass.  It's a testament to her training that she waits until you release her, looking for leave that you soon give her.  Only then does Cherish retreat.  Meanwhile you lean back, looking about Lush for your next move.  

[[Still, the drink was good.->LushHub]]


:: TableDaemon2
The shot glass is small, making it a single swallow.  It's not even half bad, a bit... slimey, but strangely devoid of flavor.  Unlike most alcohol, it doesn't even burn going down.

(if: $DrinkB is true)[Given this is your second time running Blood, you know it takes a moment.](if: $DrinkB is false)[For a long moment, you're rather certain that's all their is.  A disappointment.]  Then it hits you like a starship-- a wave of sensation that runs down your body, pricking every nerve.  Most of it recedes, but it lingers quite forcibly at your points of sensuality: lips, breasts, womanhood.  Passion and desire erupt immediately.

As you fight to keep your hand from drifting down, to press against your suddenly aching cunt, your thighs move of their own accord.  Rubbing together(if: $Plugs is true)[, your plugs shift hungrily, your womanhood wet](if: $Ballet is true)[, while your ballet heels make it difficult to stand].  (if: $Wet is true)[The words emblazoned upon your thighs are suddenly very true.]

At your side, Cherish gets your attention only after several attempts.  "Do you require assistance, Mistress?  There would of course be a small charge.  Ten credits."

(link-reveal: "No...")[[[  "YES."->TableDaemon3]]]
[["YES."->TableDaemon3]]


:: TableDaemonAsk
Cherish's smile remains.  "For the first few moments, you will find your sexuality greatly enhanced.  That effect will linger for several hours after, in a lesser magnitude, alongside a very distinct violet ring that forms around the eye."

[["On second thought... I'll pass."->TableDaemonPass]]
[[Drink it->TableDaemon2]]


:: TableDaemonPass
"I see," Cherish replies.  "Given that we have already provided your drink, a refund would not be provided... it was 50 credits, which is quite substantial."

She rocks on her heels for a moment, bangs shifting as she tilts her head.  "I cannot speak from experience, we slaves are obviously not provided with such rare drinks, but from everything I've observed Daemon's Blood is very popular.  Especially with freewombs, such as yourself, Mistress."

[[Doesn't matter.  Send her away.->LushHub]]
[[Drink it.->TableDaemon2]]


:: TableDaemon3 [Debt]
The substance coursing through your veins doesn't give you a choice, as you eagerly agree to Cherish's promised assistance.  With a knowing smile, the slave steps forward, her skirt brushing your hip as she pulls you close.
(set: $debt to it - 10)
Immediately you move to kiss her, but she holds a finger to your lips, halting you.  "Close your eyes," despite the loud music of the Club, and the crowds moving all around you, her voice is almost a whisper.

When you comply, she shifts her hand from your lips, down to the meeting of your thighs.  (if: $Sec is true)[She lifts your skirt in a single smooth motion to gain access, apparently well practiced given her own.]  

"(if: $Plugs is true)[I see you are plugged," she notes, kneading the laminate holding them in place softly.](if: $Plugs is false)[No plugs," she notes, gently kneading the laminate between your legs.  Regardless,] I bet it feels good, doesn't it?"

You moan wantonly in response, to which Cherish responds with a giggle.  "Oh, I can just *imagine.*  The initial response is almost over, however."

She presses more closely to you, still gently pressing her fingers between your legs.  As your eyes flutter back open, you can see that she is smiling.

(if: $DrinkB is true)["The violet in your eyes is even brighter now."](if: $DrinkB is false)["Your eyes... the pupils are ringed in violet, now."]

It seems to have been what she was waiting for, as Cherish pulls her white-gloved hand from you.  To your shame, your hips follow, trying to further the contact, but Cherish remains firm.

"Now, I need you to take a deep breath.  Nice and slow.  Focus."

[[Focus.->TableDaemon5]]
[["Please... help me cum."->TableDaemonCM]]


:: TableDaemon5
A return to something like the calmness you had felt before returns, with a rather great deal of effort on your part.  Yet it does come, and with it Cherish steps back, providing you with a curtsy as she retreats with tray and glass.  By the time you realize the control display on your table had been providing some manner of responsive actions, she is apparently out of range.

(if: $Sec is true)[Only belatedly do you reach down, pulling your skirt back down.](if: $Slave is true or $Brand is true)[You take one last deep breath, your corset making it a bit of an effort.](if: $Blue is true or $Smoke is true)[You take one last deep breath, the  laminate of your catsuit pulling all the tighter across your chest.]

[[Whew.->LushHub]]


:: TableDaemonCM
"That..." Cherish replies, with a hint of sadness, "I cannot do.  Not as a slave.  And you don't need it, not if you breathe.  Focus."

Begging a slave to cum in a public Club wasn't particularly well considered, after all.

:: CherishVIP
Cherish's smile grows a bit strained.  You get the sense she doesn't like being in a position where she has to tell someone 'no'.

"I must admit that I cannot give any further assistance on that topic then I already have.  My Master is very keen on maintaining the exclusivity of the place, I hope you understand?"

[["I do."->CherishHub]]
[["I suppose..."->CherishHub]]

"Questions?  About me?"  She seems slightly taken aback by the suggestion.  "Very few patrons worry themselves with such things, Mistress.  Are you sure you would not like to discuss something else?"

[["I want to ask a few questions."->CherishQQ]]
[["You're right, nevermind."->CherishHub]]


:: CherishPriv
"Ah, yes,"  Cherish nods, then is forced to reach up, adjusting her red-rimmed glasses afterward.  "Here at Lush, we strive to satisfy your every desire-- even when that comes to my own body, Mistress."

Holding her hands out a bit further to her sides, as if to give you a better view of the slick uniform coating her, she smiles.  "Many of her frequent patrons negotiate customized experiences beforehand, but we do offer a standard encounter.  For 500 credits, I would be placed at your mercy for one hour."

The way she shifts her hips, exposing the hint of white panties beneath her skirt, must be intentional.

Cherish perks up, the question being an easy one.  "Oh, I'm Torean born.  Aekoran by birth too, actually.  Grew up on one of the sharecropping estates in the countryside."

She adjusts her glasses.  "Obviously I wasn't from the family that owned the estate itself.  Most of them are Sargon or Naram-Sin owned, of course."

[["Of course."->CherishQQ]]

She flushes a bit.  "It's not a particularly interesting tale, Mistress.  Are you sure you want to inquire about this?"

[[Let her be.  "Actually, let me ask about something else."->CherishQQ]]

"Of course."  The answer is provided without a hint of hesitation.  "It pleases my Master to work the floor of Lush daily, and I would do *anything* for the pleasure of my Master."

It's hard to tell if she genuinely felt that, or if she simply feared the consequences of admitting anything else.  Torean treatment of slaves could be quite strict indeed.

[[If she's lying, she's quite good at it.  Ask about something else.->CherishQQ]]


:: CherishQLush
She shifts her head back and forth, her straight bangs flicking with each movement.  "Not as much as you would like, I think.  I've never actually been beyond the borders of Aekora.  Before I was collared, I had intended to travel all over the planet.  Now... now I have different priorities."

[["I see."->CherishQQ]]


:: CherishQSelf
"Ask *you* a question?"  Her brows rise, your suggestion clearly unexpected.  Yet she doesn't dismiss it out of hand, but chews on the idea, even warming to it.

"When you gave me your ID, when you first entered, I saw that you're an offworlder.  Can... can I ask what it's like, Mistress?  Beyond the Way Up, out there?"

She gestures towards the ceiling, but you sense she meant places far further then that-- other planets.  The galaxy at large.

"...alright," she allows, sighing.  "As I said, it's not particularly interesting or important.  I grew up in the countryside, but made for Grand Aekora as soon as I hit majority.  Wanted to live in the big city, as a freewomb-- but the vids I grew up with didn't really make it clear just how hard that could be.

The band at her throat gleams brightly.

[["I understand now."->CherishQQ]]

Cherish listens, wide-eyed.  If nothing else, you've certainly captured her imagination.  "It sounds wonderful," she replies, glancing up-- as if capable of piercing the ceiling, to glimpse the stars beyond.  "I wish I could see it, someday."

A pristine white glove brushes against her collar.  An unlikely dream.

[["I have other questions."->CherishQQ]]


:: CherishGood
"I have trouble imagining it," Cherish replies, in tones of quiet reverence.  "Even growing up in poverty, our Estate Master had farm slaves that we used on a daily basis... but worlds where no one is collared?  How does anything get done?"

Her gloved hands splay, suddenly defensive.  "Not that I meant anything by that, Mistress!"

[["No harm done.  But I do have other questions."->CherishQQ]]
[["Watch yourself, slave.  Now answer my other questions."->CherishQQ]]

"That's how I always understood it," Cherish replies, nodding along with your words.  "We always get the occasional tourist shocked to see so many Toreans in a collar, but it's just *different*.  We have our own culture here, just as ancient as any of yours."

She seems strangely proud of it, given that culture had put her in a collar, and forced her into a uniform as tight and slutty as she wore.

[["Agreed.  Now, I have other questions?"->CherishQQ]]


:: CherishBad
Your zeal for slavery and subservience are well demonstrated, although Cherish's pursed lips suggest she was biting down on giving you a taste of her mind.  Given her slavery, that was probably a well-honed survival instict.

She finally settles on a response with a bit of a smile.  "You certainly are growing well-accustomed to how things work here, as an offworlder.  If a collar is what you seek, I'm sure you will make a Master or Mistress very happy some day."

(set: $debt to it - 500)"As you wish," Cherish responds.  (if: $debt is < 0)["I see this transaction will take you into a negative account balance.  I would recommend being careful, while we allow such circumstances to persist, Truant Officers rarely approve of such recklessness."]

She lifts the front of her skirt, bowing to you.  "You need only wait here, Mistress, to await my preparation for your use.  Another servant will be along shortly to escort you to the private room that will be at your disposal for the coming hour."

Moving away from you, Cherish stops at the bar, speaking with the bartender before making for the hallway marked with the neon pillow.  As promised, it's not long after before another uniformed slave approaches you.  She presents you with a key.

"Room 12, Mistress.  She's waiting for you."

[[Make your way there.->CherishPriv3]]


:: CherishPriv3
Making your way to the pillow-marked corridor, you enter into a dimly lit hallway, the neon numbers above each door the only guide as you step forward.  From several of the other doors you hear the sounds of revelry, be it music, conversation, or acts of sensuality.  And indeed, it was the promise of that last one that eventually brings you to stand before Door 12.  Reaching down, you press your keycard against the attendant pad, and it opens...

[[Step inside.->CherishPriv4]]


:: CherishPriv4
The room is dim, sensual.  A bed is against the far wall, as well as a couple other pieces of furniture, but your attention focuses immediately on the woman bound directly before you-- the sconce above her providing a spotlight.  Cherish, still in her uniform, locked at wrist and ankle to an X-shaped frame.  

She's spread-eagle, defenseless, a baby blue ball firmly locked between her teeth.  Meeting your gaze, she smiles despite the gag, wriggling a bit in her restraints before looking down and to the side.  Next to her sits a small folding tray, displaying a handful of useful implements.

The slave is yours alone to play with.

[[Take stock.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CherishPrivHub
Before you, Cherish is bound and wrist and ankle-- helpless.  A bit of drool runs down her gag as she looks to you, wondering what comes next.  To her side stands the small tray, wand, baton, dildo, and whip at the ready.  A full Torean arsenal.

(if: $CherishT is < 0)[Your choices seem to be having an effect on the slave, you notice.

:: CExplore
Approaching slowly, you notice Cherish watching you closely.  When your hand finds her waist, just above where the tight material covering her abdomen changed over to her skirt, you feel a hint of a shiver from the slave.  Trepidation.
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)
Her laminate is warm to the touch, however, slick and glossy beneath your hand.  Looking up, she meets your gaze with a lidded look, arching her back a bit to press into your touch.  Encouraging you.

:: CAdjust
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)Stepping up to the bound slave, you take note of her bindings.  Rendered in heavy duty laminate, they take the form of cuffs that are in turn linked to the X-shaped cross by short lengths of chain.  Those securing her wrists rattle as you lean in, Cherish watching you inqusitively as you examine the work.

Release her entirely was impossible, but loosening the chains a bit to allow her to rest more easily on her heels would be possible.  Alternatively, however, at least two links each could be reduced by snapping them together, dramatically tightening her bondage.

:: CTouch
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)Stepping up, you place one hand on Cherish's waist as your other dips down, finding the bright white laminate of her panties.  The bound slave immediately thrusts her hips out, both a clear demonstration of her training and from sheer desire-- her lidded eyes look to you, goading you on.

[[Slide a finger beneath her panties.->CTouchF]]

:: CVibe
Reaching for the tray of implements set to the side for your use, Cherish sways her hips as your hand settles upon the vibrating wand.  Consisting of a thick handle, the tip is wide, blunted, and capable of *considerable* vibrations when you flick the switch to engage it.
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)
Approaching Cherish, it's effects are made apparent as soon as you make contact with her alabaster panties, the slave squirming with delight as she arches her back, trying to press her cunt harder into the sweet sensations.

:: CShock
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)Reaching for the tray of implements set to the side for your use, Cherish visibly shivers as you take up the shock baton.  Fully black, the handle gives way to a rounded metallic end cap-- the design intended to remain useful even when pressed against laminate.

Testing the device by pressing down the singular button, you're greated with an electric snapping sound that's matched with a lick of electricty arcing across the metallic head.

Cherish moans dejectedly.

(set: $Cherish to it + 1)Cherish's eyes follow as your attention shifts upward, to the smooth curvature of her chest.  The soft blue laminate of her uniform clings tightly to her form as you run a hand gently along, observing the buttons and front closure-- an interesting detail, given she had mentioned it being applied via wardrobe device, and thus quite literally printed on.

The slave is shapely, but its her nipples that you focus on, the bits of metal that signified piercings standing out when run across.

:: CWhip
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)"Mmmmgh..."

For once Cherish speaks up immediately, having watched you reach for the whip.  Bound and gagged, utterly helpless, she tries to stay your hand with the only thing left to the slave-- her own body.  Pressing her chest out, her already lidded gaze grows even more sensual, an unspoken promise being made.

*Spare me, and I'll be a good girl for you.*
(set: $WhipC to 0)
[[Set the whip down.  Approach her instead.->CWhipIgnore]]
[[Take up the lash!->CWhip2]]


:: CSkip
(set: $Cherish to it + 1)Instead of furthering Cherish's torment or pleasure, you instead give the girl a chance to rest.  Settling down in the chair provided near the door, you reflect on your situation.  

You still couldn't remember much of your own past, but here you now sat, deep in a Torean city-- a slave, collared and uniformed, bound for your pleasure, utterly helpless before you.  What strange paths we walk.

After some time, you eventually rouse.

[[You consider your options further.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CherishPrivEnd
Your time is up, and you move towards the door just as another knock breaks the quiet of the room.

Yet... as you do so, you notice one tool still left on the tray of implements at your disposal.  *The dildo.*

(if: $CherishT is < 0)[Despite your cruelty to her, ](if: $CherishT is > 0)[Perhaps because of your kindness to her, ]Cherish seems to realize the possibility too, thrusting hard against her restraints.  Begging you for the pleasure it could provide-- perhaps even climax.

Another knock, growing more insistent, is made against the door.

[[Turn back for the dildo.->CherishEndDoor]]
[[You don't want to risk it, go to the door.->CEndDil]]


:: CExploreDown
You move your hands slowly downward from Cherish's waist.  Her skirt immediately intercedes, but you glide over that easily enough, the ruffled laminate of her petticoats providing little in the way of actual coverage or protection.  That allows you access to her panties, bright white and pulled tight between her legs, disappearing between the cleft of her rear.

[[Tease her gently.->CExploreDownNice]]
[[Tease her roughly.->CExploreDownBad]]
[[Keep going down.->CExploreDown2]]


:: CExploreUp
You move your hands slowly upward from Cherish's waist, following the smooth curve from her narrowest point, along the powder blue laminate of her uniform.  The white buttons that decorate the front give way to the swell of her breasts beneath, your inquiring hands quickly ascertaining that each nipple is pierced-- which you twist softly, eliciting a quite moan as you continue on your way.

Her collar is a two part affair, the outermost a decorative bit of laminate, folded stylishly and buttoned at the front much like the bodice.  Beneath that however is a band of pure silvered steel, pulled tight against her throat.  The club's logo is emblazoned upon the front, as well as a serial code of some sort-- knowing Torei, of use to Truant Officers or the like.

Reaching her chin you're presented with an opportunity, however-- gagged as she is, cutting off her oxygen would be easy enough.  A mere pinch of the nose, for instant breathplay.  

Cherish looks to you, squirming slightly.

[[Pinch her nose.->CExploreUp2]]
[[Step back, your examination complete.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CExploreDownNice
(set: $CherishT to it + 1)Sliding down between her legs, your hand comes to rest against her womanhood, only the thin layer of laminate there protecting her.  Further up she again looks to you, if not begging then certainly seeking your affection.

She gets it with two of your fingers being used to press against her lips, the presence of a piercing in her clit becoming immediately apparent.  That Cherish felt it too is made clear by the way she suddenly pulls against her bindings, moaning gently in her gag.  Your ministrations are gentle, but insistent, and its not long before she starts to pant-- and you abandon the effort, letting the tease be enough for now.

Her frustrated but happy mewl suggests approval nevertheless.

[[You continue working down her body.->CExploreDown2]]


:: CExploreDownBad
(set: $CherishT to it - 1)Sliding down between her legs, your hand comes to rest against her womanhood, only the thin layer of laminate there protecting her.  Further up she again looks to you, if not begging then certainly seeking your affection.

She does not get it.  Immediately you feel the presence of a ring piercing her clit, and focus upon it immediately, rubbing the sensative nub forcibly.  Cherish reacts as one might expect, pulling hard against her restraints as she tries to speak-- although her gag renders that into little more than muffled moans.  That you're having an effect is made apparent by the way her knees shift in, however, the only defensive measure she could manage as she begins to quiver from so much direct stimulation.  Bringing her to cum right then and there would have been easy enough, but it's then you back off suddenly, leaving her unsated.

Her upturned brows and quivering limbs speak to a distinct distaste for being so roughly treated.  Not that she has a choice.

[[You continue working down her body.->CExploreDown2]]


:: CExploreDown2
Returning to her hips if only to continue moving down her thighs, you pass briefly over the garters that hold her stockings up-- the tight bands of laminate disappearing beneath her skirt, undoubtedly connecting to a belt secreted somewhere above.  

The stockings themselves are as smooth as glossy as the rest of her uniform.  White bands at the top of each thigh give way to blue further down, until her heeled shoes become apparent at the very bottom, the towering platforms improving her height dramatically.

[[A wonderful examination.  Step back.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CExploreUp2
(set: $CherishT to it - 1)Her thin red glasses rest on the bridge of her nose as you reach up, thumb and forefinger closing quickly upon her nostrils.  Immediately her eyes find your own as tries to pull free, her own collar impeding that effort.  It's immediately clear that she doesn't enjoy the experience-- but then again, that's not her choice to make.

[[Release her, and step back.->CherishPrivHub]]
[[Hold her a bit longer.->CExploreUp3]]


:: CExploreUp3
"Mmmmmmgh!"  Struggling against her bondage and your light torture, Cherish tries to breath around her ball gag, a difficult endeavor.  Yet her efforts allow you an excellent view of her bound body writhing, pert chest pressed out and swaying, full hips shifting back and forth.  

It's almost a shame when you finally decide to release her, the slave's nostrils flaring as she tries to suck in much desired oxygen.  For a moment she hangs loosely in her bindings, but does recover, eyes narrowed slightly in your direction.

You get the sense she didn't like that.

[[Step back.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CAdjustGood
(set: $CherishT to it + 1)Cherish turns her head to watch as you reach up, momentarily forcing her first wrist further up.  That gives you the slack to then loosen the binding by at least a full link, giving the bound slave that much more liberty.  Repeating the effort on her other limbs allows her to rest more easily.

Cherish responds by testing the new adjustment, her body momentarily straining against the bonds.  What she finds clearly pleases her, a nod of thanks being delivered your way.

A job well done.

[[Step back.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CAdjustBad
(set: $CherishT to it - 1)Cherish turns her head to watch as you reach up, momentarily forcing her first wrist further up.  That gives you the slack to then slip an additional two links of her chain upon the hook holding it there, instantly forcing her limb to pull taut against the cross behind it.  The slave notices the change immediately, pulling her to regain her lost liberty even as you progress to her other arm.

By the time you finish with all four, the uniformed woman's predicament had moved beyond mere helplessness to a direct discomfort, her body spread so forcibly you see her struggling-- and failing-- to find a comfortable position.  Drool runs down her gag and lands upon her chest in result, Cherish complainly openly with a low moan.

A job well done.

[[Step back.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CTouchF
With her hips shifted slightly forward, the minscule cover Cherish's skirt normally provided is completely voided.  Thus her panties are easily accessible, your hand upon them working slowly to invade, until a singular finger slips beneath the slick laminate.  

Feeling the intrusion Cherish moans softly, pressing her hips out further, seeking your attention.

[[Play with her a bit more.-->CTouchF2]]
[[Enter her.->CTouchFGG]]


:: CTouchC
With your finger on her panties the ring embedded in her clit is readily apparent, a bit of hard metal amongst her soft womanhood.  Focusing on the piercing through the laminate of her panties, you eventually seize it gently with a pair of fingers.  Even the slightest pull ellicits an immediate reaction from the slave, Cherish being like most women in that such direct stimulation could often be overwhelming.

Swiveling her hips to press them out further, she wantonly seeks your attention.

[[Play with her a bit more.-->CTouchC2]]
[[Pull hard on her clit ring.->CTouchC2GG]]


:: IsQCheckFAIL
The black-clad Mistress looks to you with a clear frown, her gloved hand rapping against the bench she sat upon in irritation. 

"I would have hoped you would have picked up on the necessity of watching one's words by now.  To be on your knees is to be under another's power, and if you fail to respect that power..."

Her tone alone suggests the folly of such a decision, but ultimately Isabella pushes the thought away.

"You are lucky that I will not hold that against you.  Now, let us see how you did."

This time she glares at you expectantly.

From the vantage of your approach, you get your first good look at the VIP member known as Tysus Sargon.  She's seated alone in the center of a crescent-shaped booth, the plush dark material drinking in the light of the club.  She would have been all but invisible had she not been focused on a haptic display projected before her, massive data tables running down before her as she leans in, adjusting black-rimmed glasses.

As should have perhaps been expected, her outfit is pure laminate, the strictly business look of her pencil skirt offset by the semi-transparent material of the shirt she wears, the front pulled open exposing the bra worn underneath.  That mixture of serious scholarship and playful sensuality seems to define her, from the outfit to her hair, black strands pulled into a tight bun-- but offset, producing an appeal asymmetrical effect.

At that moment she holds a stylus in her hand, tapping it gently against blood-red lips.  There is absolutely no doubt in your mind that she had failed to notice you, or much of anything else passing by.

[["Mistress Sargon?"->SargonTalk]]
[[Wait for her to notice you.->SargonWait]]
(if: $PlayE is true)[[[Use your training, perform a reverence.->SargonRev]]]


:: SargonTalk
"Hmm?"  For the first time Tysus actually looks *at* you, her middle finger reaching up to push her glasses up her nose a bit.  Clearly looking over your apparel, she waves you off with a sharp gesture.

(if: $Blue is true)["Go away, girl-in-blue.  I will accept no proposition from you, sell your body or whatever it is you intend elsewhere."](if: $Smoke is true)["Semi-transparent laminate is... a well considered look.

:: SargonWait
Moving into a position directly before the table, you adopt a polite approach, waiting for the Torean Mistress to notice your presence.  It's a well considered means of greeting-- if Tysus noticed you at all.  Quickly several minutes pass, and despite flicking through a handful of data logs, the VIP member seems to have missed your presence completely.

[[Speak up.  "Mistress Sargon?"->SargonTalk]]
(if: $PlayE is true)[[[Use your training, perform a reverence.->SargonRev]]]


:: SargonRev
Having approached the table, (if: $Sec is true)[you reach down, lifting your skirt to reveal your womanhood underneath.](else:)[you move your hands to the sides of your hips, folding them back.]  Bowing, you notice your movement had drawn Tysus' attention.  Protocol dictated you hold the reverence until greeted, and the Mistress before you clearly allows the pose to go long, only finally speaking up after a good minute.

"Your etiquette and humility are noted(if: $Slave is true)[ slave], but my research is much too important to allow for any manner of distraction.  You are dismissed." 

(if: $Slave is true)[[["I'm not a slave, check my ID if you wish.  But I do need your help."->SargonGreet3]]](else:)[[["Actually, I was wondering if I could ask for your assistance..."->SargonGreet3]]]


:: SargonGreet3
Tysus sighs, but to her credit does set her stylus down, looking up at you from her seated position.  "Explain."

You do.  Not the particulars, just the nature of your predicament, the need for a VIP sponsor.  She listens, the way she seems to be staring through you, the way her fingers rap against the table, you get the sense of impending dismissal-- until you happen to mention one small detail: the Black Card.

Sitting up sharply, Tysus looks to you intently.  You suddenly have her full and undivided attention.  "Have you seen it?"

[["Seen what?"->SargonGreet4]]
[["I'm not sure what you mean, Mistress?"->SargonGreet4]]


:: SargonGreet4
"The *Daemon*."  It's a word she speaks with more than a little bit of awe, even reverence.  "A figure in pure black laminate, but... so much more.  An emissary, a fragment of divinity, a herald of... of..."

She catches herself before running further into what you sense would have been a lengthy speech, and instead focuses, placing her hands on the table before looking to you again.

"That black card you hold is... an exceptional item.  A direct communication from a *Daemon*.  I have so many questions... you *will* answer them."

She doesn't give you an opportunity to resist, but does-- after a moment-- provide a carrot to go along with that stick.  "And I will answer any questions that you may have.  Tysus, of House Sargon, by the way.  Charmed."

Even so, she still doesn't offer you a seat.

[[Well, at least your foot is in the proverbial door.->SargonHub]]


:: SargonAsk
"Questions, yes-- most certainly.  One moment."  Picking up her stylus, the Torean Mistress adjusts the holographic display before her, swtiching the data stream to a panel that covers most of the table in a bright glow.  While the laminate of her loose-fitting shirt passes right through, her stylus marks the hardlight much like paper as she looks to you again.

"We return to my original question then-- have you *seen* it?  The Daemon.  Interacted with it?  Spoke with it?"

(if: $Daemon is true)[[["Yes I have, in an alley earlier today..."->SargonAskDY]]]
[["Not that I can remember."->SargonAskDN]]


:: SargonPersonal
"I promised to speak of Daemons, not myself," Tysus replies sharply, only for a sly smile to cross her carefully painted lips.  "But I do respect a sense of curiosity.  If you have questions, ask them.

[[You're a bit surprised that worked.->SargonPHub]]


:: SargonDae
Tysus smiles, the expression almost predatory when cloaked in the shadow of the booth as she is.  "Why, that's my favorite subject.  Speak."

[["So what exactly is a Daemon?"->DaeWhatAre]]
[["Everyone seems to fear Daemons, why is that?"->DaeFear]]

[["That's all for now, actually."->SargonHub]]


:: SargonVIP
Bringing a hand to her chest, Tysus Sargon laughs.  "Are you asking that I bring some Offworlder(if: $Slave is true)[, in a slave suit nonetheless,] along with me when I confront a Daemon?  Certainly not.  I will handle this entirely by myself.  The accolades will be mine, and mine alone."

[["I... understand."->SargonHub]]

[["Please, I need to get up there!  I need to make that deal!"->SargonAngerCred]]

Tysus shakes her head immediately.  "I will not speak of anything else until you submit to my questions."

[["I understand."->SargonHub]]
[["I understand, Mistress."->SargonHub]]
[[Nod your head.->SargonHub]]


:: SargonAskDY
"You have?  And so close?"  Tysus writes furiously, taking notes far more copious then your own spoken words.  "Tell me more!"

There isn't much to tell, in truth, and you're not exactly sure how much of it you had perceived correctly.  Looking back on the experience it almost feels more like a dream, details slipping away as hour is stacked atop hour, and the encounter fades.  

"That's not uncommon," the Mistress continues, as if sensing your confusion.  "The one rule that we who research Daemons know for sure is that Daemons are erratic, acting in manners and ways we do not full understand.  But testimonies occasionally mention a sense of altered perception when in proximity.  Fascinating."

Tapping her stylus against the table, she looks to you again.

"Did you encounter a similiar reaction when you first acquired the Black Card?"

[["Actually, I can't exactly remember how I got it...->SargonAsk2]]


:: SargonAskDN
Tysus notes your response, her notations far longer then your actual verbal response. "That's not unexpected," she explains meanwhile.  "Daemons never seem to act in predicatable ways, but there are common denominators in what we can observe.  Maintaining a distance from even those they have interest in is one of them.  Although... I would guess that if you had paid attention, you may have caught a glimpse out of the corner of your eye on occasion."

She looks up, tilting her head to the side.  "Wait a minute-- how did you come into possession of the Black Card, then?"

[["Well... I can't exactly recall..."->SargonAsk2]]


:: SargonAsk2
A report of amnesia associated with Daemons seems to intrigue Tysus, but her interest fades once you mention the Mem-Burn you had found in your hotel bedroom that morning.  

"Well," she concludes with a sigh, "I suppose just how you acquired that Black Card will remain a mystery.  Most unfortunate.  While the materials seem distinctly polar in origin, most reported cases seem to involve Black Cards being left to be discovered, or given by a third party.  Some even seem to have been placed randomly, with frequently unfortunate results for those who come into posesssion of them..."

She shrugs, but instead focuses on the other detail you had mentioned: the address on the card leading you here.

"Do you at least recall why it would summon you here?"

*With her interest in Daemons, telling her about your deal could endanger the entire thing.*

"You will *not* hold back relevent details from me, is that clear?  My work would suffer were that the case, and *I* will not suffer that.  Do we have an understanding?"

"A deal, you say..." Tysus sits back, reclining in the plush material of her booth as she considers your words.  "It must be with a Daemon, this cannot be a coincidence.  The Black Card you hold, pulling you to this place.  All of it matching a spike in Daemon sightings in this area, centered on this very Club?"

(set: $SargonNo to true)
She leans back, reclining jealously in the plush material of her booth.  It's a pose she holds for a long moment, before placing both arms on the table, hands collecting together before her nose.  Her glasses catch the light as she looks up to you, reflections making them all but opaque.

"This cannot be a coincidence, then.  Your presence here, at the behest of a Black Card.  Sightings of a Daemon... I will learn the truth of this.  By myself, of course."

"No," she concludes, saving the data she had pulled from you before returning the holographic display to its running data arrays.  "You have my leave to go."

It takes her several moments to remember her own words, but to her credit she does speak up again.  "And I suppose I will answer any questions you have on Daemons, if that would sate you."

*At the very least, your suspicions are confirmed: the Black Card is a product of the polar AIs and their mysterious Daemons.  Your deal may very well be with that which seems to induce both fear and fascination in the native population.  And Tysus' tone?  She sounded liable to act on your information independently.

Boldly, you finger her clit then travel downward, sliding your finger between feminine folds slick with desire.  Cherish's gagged moan is heartfelt, you get the sense that she rarely was allowed such experiences-- and knowing Torean culture, you had to imagine never by her own hand.
(set: $CherishT to it + 1)

With cruel intent, you use your position to seize more fully upon her pierced clit, pulling on the soft flesh.

(set: $CherishT to it - 1)
By the third time you repeat the little maneuver you notice her eyes narrowed with frustration, her chest rising and falling from sharp breaths.  She may not have liked it rationally, but your fingers are quite wet-- her body had betrayed her.

Rattling a bit in her restraints, Cherish nevertheless is quick to act once you make your desires clear.  The cuff at her ankle prevents total movement of the leg, but she has enough liberty to shift her thigh, grinding it against your cunt.  The sensation is pleasing, if a bit distant, the logistics of the effort somewhat difficult given your relative positions.

It also quickly seems to tire Cherish out, her ministrations growing slower as the effort required to move her leg proved uncomfortable.  Nevertheless it's clear she would have continued had you not pulled back(if: $Sec is true)[, pulling down your skirt again,]  and stepped back.

Not every choice is the right one.

[[Consider your choices further.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CVibeNice
In a display of charity, you allow Cherish to seek out the vibrator at her will.  She uses the opportunity to its fullest, pressing her cunt against the device as hard as she can manage, straining against her bondage to further the effort from better leverage.  It's a perhaps unsurprising display of her submission and promiscuity, the life of a Torean slave rarely allowing for such an opportunity.
(set: $CherishT to it + 1)
Eventually however you pull your arm back, earning a frustrated moan from the drooling slave as she shakes her hips.  Certainly you had never intended to allow her to cum, right?  

Despite the frustration, you get the sense she's pleased.

[[Step back and consider your options.->CherishPrivHub]]


:: CVibeMean
Noting her slutty behavior immediately, you correct it by withdrawing the vibrator-- and delivering a sharp slap to her hip.  Cherish bucks in her restraints, taken by surprise, even as her hips still dance-- hungry for further experience with the vibrator.

When you do eventually provide it she demonstrates a lesson learned however, approaching the sensations more carefully, watching your eyes even as she sought to look down-- carefully attempting to avoid your displeasure.  Even when doing so much right you eventually pull the vibrator back again however, earning a frustrated moan once you flick the switch off.

As you focus on Cherish's laminate covered chest, the bound slave clearly understands your intent.  Her training shows through as she gamely retains her position (not that she really had an option otherwise), trembling only slightly as you get closer.

Pressing the baton against her breasts, you provide her with a quick test of the device by flicking the switch.  

"Mmmmmgh..." Cherish keeps her response relatively quiet, gritting through the sensations you force upon her well enough.

If Cherish thought that was all you would attempt, she's soon sorely mistaken.  Reaching up again, this time you press the baton more firmly against her tits, and hold the trigger for longer. 

The crackle of the device engaging is met with a more immediate gagged moan this time, one that devolves into something like a scream as you hold Cherish to the proverbial fire.  Most of the current passes into her unseen, but of those that are visible you notice the arcing electricty seemingly focusing on her nipples-- a direct result of the piercings she bore in each.

As you return the baton to her breasts for the third time, Cherish finally breaks.  Her struggling increases considerably as she attempts to pull away, to shield herself from your cruel intentions.

Realizing her fate, she calms as you press the device against her laminate, and instead looks into your eyes-- begging silently for a reprieve.

You take the gentle approach, fondling and tweaking her nipples instead of anything more aggressive.

It's a situation that allows you to easily lean in, first kissing her chest, then suckling her nipple through the laminate.  The position required prevents you from observing Cherish's reaction, but the tight little moan you hear makes it clear enough-- you had pleasantly surprised her.

You take the opportunity for aggression, Cherish's bound form too tempting to resist.  Lulling her into a false sense of security is easy enough, gentle fondling providing as much-- which only heightens the impact when you suddenly seize upon one of her pierced nipples, tweaking it hard.  Cherish grunts into her gag in response, her back arching in a natural reaction to lesson the pain.  Her eyes had been closing but they snap back open now, looking to you with a hint of betrayal.

(set: $CherishT to it + 2)(set: $debt to it - 100)The door to the hallway beyond is opened to reveal another uniformed slave, a universal keycard held in her gloved hands.  Quickly looking across the scene, her look of concern shifts to a pleasing smile-- one that allows just a *hint* of jealously to run across her features upon seeing Cherish sagging in her restraints, cum dripping from between her legs.

"Mistress," the other slave greets, performing a polite curtsy.  "I see you... quite enjoyed your time with our Cherish?  You must have, if you thought it worth an extra 100 credits for going over your appointed time."

Behind you, Cherish moans in sweet relief.  Clearly *she* thought you had made the right decision.

"Well," the other slave continues, "I will see that Cherish is cleaned up, and she will soon be back on the floor.  Please, Mistress, return to the club proper."

You do, stepping past the newcomer to emerge back out into the hallway beyond, and then the club floor, making for your table.

Tysus Sargon looks to you expectantly, waiting for your questions regarding herself.

[["What is House Sargon, exactly?"->SargonWhatHouse]]
[["Did you go to a university of some sort, to study Daemons?"->SargonWhatUni]]
[["Do you own any slaves?"->SargonWhatSlaves]]
[["That's all the questions I have now."->SargonHub]]


:: SargonWhatHouse
"You are not familiar with House Sargon?"  She looks up at you, incredulous, before an adjustment of her glasses masks a realization.  "Ah, your... memory issues.  Of course.  Well, suffice it to say, House Sargon is one of the two Diarchic families in this Ringdom, along with House Naram-Sin.  We each control a Prime Market, the massive slave markets that are central to the Aekoran economy, and we both elect a Diarch-- one from each family making executive decisions."

She collects her hands together on the table.  "House Sargon is very large, however.  Hundreds of existant members.  Instead of pursuing an administrative career, one that would lead into politics, I chose an academic one."

[["Interesting."->SargonPHub]]


:: SargonWhatUni
"No," she replies immediately, but does clarify.  "In that I mean that Daemonology isn't a particularly widespread discipline.  Only a few institutions of higher learning concern themselves with the polar AIs, and none of those in Aekora have that distinction.  But I do have degrees in Material Science, Engineering, and Sociology."

Given her youth, she must have been a prodigy.  Torean biomedical technology went far, but it hadn't expanded to the point of providing that sort of intelligence.

Tysus meanwhile shrugs her narrow shoulders.  "They are useful disciplines for the study of Daemons, but in that particular field I am what one would call *self-taught*."

[["I see."->SargonPHub]]


:: SargonWhatSlaves
She pauses.  "I do.  Although only a personal assistant.  My family provides a subsidy, of course, but if I am need of anything further I simply utilize my contacts with the nearby Finishing Academy.  They are always willing to lend me a few girls, if the need arises.  Otherwise, a scholar's life is not particularly flush with credits."

[[Of course.->SargonPHub]]


:: DaeWhatAre
As Tysus draws herself up, you realize you're in for a bit of a lecture.

"Daemon," she begins, "is a colloquial term, one generally carrying a negative connotation.  'Emissary' is another, much the opposite in that it is generally used by those intending a positive connotation.  The *proper* term, however, is an Isolation Laminate."

A professor in tone and appearance if not demeanor, Tysus adjusts her glasses before continuing.  "I prefer the term 'Daemon' because I think it important to not forget their origin, but 'Isolation Laminate' does drill to the heart of the matter-- in that with most everything regarding such creatures, we are speaking of the suit.  A human does reside within, but in a state we cannot fully speak to.  The suit controls them, conditions them, enslaves them."

[["Where do they come from?"->DaeWhere]]
[["What do they want?"->DaeWhat]]
[["So are the humans within aware?"->DaeAware]]
[["Why use humans at all?"->DaeWhyHuman]]
[["That's enough on what they are, for now."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeFear
"That, at least, has a clear answer."  Leaning in, the shadows of the booth in which Tysus shade occlude her eyes, drowning them in shadow.  "To be of interest to a Daemon is to be of interest to the polar AIs.  Imagine that.  Mazos and Dahome are beings of infinite wisdom, vast and terrible, more akin to forces of nature or even *Gods* then anything we can understand in our frail morality.  When you stand face to face with a Daemon, you are in turn looking into the eye of impossible vastness-- and it has broken from its cosmic divinity to look back into you."

She leans back, returning the light.  "Why would it do that?"

[[Perhaps some questions are better left unanswered."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeSuits
"That is always the subject of most interest," Tysus muses, with only a slight roll of the eyes.  "It is important in the study of Daemonology, of course, but there is a general fascination from the public in that which confounds belief.  But I shall indulge you.  Ask."

:: DaeSightings
"Yes."  With an outstretched arm, the loose laminate of her jacket demonstrating its transparency as it passes over the neon Club, Tysus indicates Lush in its entirety.  "It is why I am here.  Both generally, in that I am on location, and specifically-- in that I am in this booth, on the ground level instead of the VIP.  From here I can watch all entrances and exits to the Club.  I'm watching for it.  A male, I'm told."

She taps her hand on the table.  "This information you have brought me, however... I will be acting on it shortly.  Breaking my vigilance to confirm my own theory.  That you have been summoned by a Daemon via that Black Card.(if: $SargonNo is true)[  I very well may have already, if you hadn't made the pitifully poor decision to deny me the information I need, during the earlier questioning."]"

[["I want to ask about something else."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeBlackCard
"The facts as we know it align," the Torean Mistress concludes.  "I cannot speak to why Mem-Burn was used upon you, or by your own hand, but the Black Card is the key.  Somewhere in that lost past, you made contact with a Daemon-- or someone who is in turn in contact with one.  (if: $SargonNo is true)[If you had told me why you are here when I asked earlier, perhaps I could deduce more.  As it is?  I will need to go up to the VIP area soon, and act upon my hypothesis."](if: $SargonNo is false)[What you told me, that you are here to make a deal of some sort, only furthers my hypothesis.  I will need to go up to the VIP area soon, confront the creature."]

[["I want to ask about something else."->SargonDae]]
(if: $SargonBother is false)[[["Can you take me with you, up into the VIP area?"->SargonVIP]]]


:: DaeWhere
"That question's answer is as old as human settlement on Torei.  Did you know this planet isn't... *natural?*  It was constructed, from stellar dust and debris, by the polar AIs.  Mazos and Dahome, as we call them.  They built this planet over passing aeons, then cultivated its atmosphere-- and finally set to work on populating it.  Thus the first humans were bred, but when they proved unruly... the Isolation Laminates.  Leave it to an artifical intelligence to take such an efficient approach, converting dissidents into slave-overseers."

Tysus flicks open an annotated timeline upon her holographic display, its sheer length demonstrating Torei's great age.  "We broke free, of course.  After the Sharecropping Wars, the first Ringdoms were founded.  But the AIs still have their slaves, deep within their polar ziggurats-- and the occasional unfortunate in an Isolation Laminate still walks among us.  Daemons, haunting outer villages and performing strange acts in the night to some.  Emissaries to others, providing boons and communicating-- as best they can-- the desires of their AI Masters."

[["What do they want?"->DaeWhat]]
[["So are the humans within aware?"->DaeAware]]
[["Why use humans at all?"->DaeWhyHuman]]
[["That's enough on what they are, for now."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeWhat
"Now, *that* is the vexing question."  Tysus leans back, reclining in her booth.  One arm stretches out along the top, the other gesturing as she speaks.  "Simply put: we do not know.  To understand their intentions, you would need to understand their Masters-- and the polar AIs are beyond strange.  They do no think as we do, they do not have personalities to interact with, we are not even sure if their consciousness is gestalt, unified, or some other obscure form of sentience.  Think... think of the Daemons as a thousand fingers emerging from a terrifying hand, so vast as to be almost infinite.  We cannot hope to perceive what such a hand would intend to grasp."

[["Why use humans at all?"->DaeWhyHuman]]
[["That's enough on what they are, for now."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeAware
"I sincerely hope not," Tysus replies, lips drawing into a tight line.  "Evidence however... suggests we cannot jump to conclusions, either way.  Leading theories suggest the prisoner, if we may use that term, is perhaps in a perpetual fugue state.  Slipping into and out of perception.  Daemons have been observed working through pleasure cycles, however-- a clear indicator of the human within being stimulated."

[["Where do they come from?"->DaeWhere]]
[["What do they want?"->DaeWhat]]
[["Why use humans at all?"->DaeWhyHuman]]
[["That's enough on what they are, for now."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeWhyHuman
"Another good question," the professorial Mistress replies, tapping her fingers upon the table.  "The intial reason for their creation makes sense-- converting dissidents among the AI's slave populations into easily managed testaments to their will.  But why persist in this program, after so many centuries?  I do have a theory, though."

She leans in.  "They persist because we allow it.  Most Ringdoms maintain strict non-interaction laws with Daemons, and in turn they wander freely.  Eyes and ears for the AIs, nudging the events in their grand machinations."

[["Where do they come from?"->DaeWhere]]
[["What do they want?"->DaeWhat]]
[["So are the humans within aware?"->DaeAware]]
[["That's enough on what they are, for now."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeEnclose
"Yes.  Fully.  Of that we are certain.  From helmet to heels, which yes-- both genders wear.  The material itself is laminate, much like you or I bear, but the AIs have ensured only the Daemons have access to what is clearly a more advanced composition.  Details vary, and as always firsthand reports are rare, but shape-shifting of a limited variety as well as complete vacuum protection have been reported.  That they persist on internal air recycling has been demonstrated rather simply, by a lack of observed condensation from breathing in colder environments."

Tysus pauses.  "What the suit inflicts upon its wearer in such a closed environment is not altogether clear, however.  (if: $Slave is true)[I would think it somewhat comparable to your own circumstances, however."  

She gestures towards your standardized slave suit.

[["Like my suit?"->DaeSlaveSS]]](else:)[I imagine it being something like that which we inflict upon slaves wearing the standardized suit some in this Ringdom require of slaves in this Ringdom, if you have ever witnessed such a situation.

:: DaeDefense
"Hardly!  There is a reason there has never been a confirmed capture of a Daemon for more then a few hours.  Most commonly we get reports of electric discharge from their gloves-- akin a shock baton.  Their suits can shift in shape to a limited degree as well, forming blades or most anything else they need.  And *that* is all on top of their strength.  Once again, theories vary as to the particulars of how they do it but they can demonstrate exceptional strength at times-- such as bending steel bars, or the like.  Those suits are incredible.

[["Those are all the questions I have for now on their suits."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeRecharge
Tysus nods.  "Now you're thinking like a researcher.  Given their abilities, the apparent semi-direct control exerted over them-- they must require constant power infusions, right?  Well you would be wrong.  Daemons have been observed operating for several weeks unimpeded, and even longer while sitting... or bound... in dormant states.  But this is one of the subjects in which we *do* understand how they do it.  Are you familiar with piezoelectricty?"

She doesn't wait for you to actually reply, continuing instead.  "Certain materials can generate electricty in response to mechanical stress... such as the metallic boning of a corset.  Yes it enforces the intended waistline, but with every breath the wearer stresses the material-- and we have nigh-infinite energy."

The Mistress actually smiles for once.  "Even the male Daemons are corseted, if you're wondering.  Serves them right, I have alwas wondered why only us women generally wear such things..."

[["Are they fully enclosed?"->DaeEnclose]]

[["Are the people within still... there?  Mentally?"->DaeMent]]
[["Those are all the questions I have for now on their suits."->SargonDae]]


:: DaeRelease
"That is another point of contention.  The best I can respond with is... *perhaps*.  Within the polar ziggaruts that are both the bodies of Mazos and Dahom, as well as the prisons that hold their human slaves, we believe there are... something like living quarters.  Some theories suggest that those within the Isolation Laminates *are* eventually released into such areas, after their terms of service are done."

She shrugs.  "What we do not have are any reports of Daemons being released back into *our* societies."

[["What of the opposite?  Does anyone ever... join them?"->DaeJoin]]

:: DaeMent
"As with so many things, we cannot be certain," Tysus replies.  "The AIs do not part with their Daemons-- **ever**.  There are of course stories of damaged Isolation Laminates, of brief escapes from them... but it's strange, they always seem to end the same way: with the slave returning from whence they came.  Back into the clutches of the AI.  What madness would drive them to that?"

She lets you ponder the question for a moment, but as always has an answer of her own ready.  "I think it most likely that the experience of wearing such a suit... changes a person."

[["How do you mean?"->DaeMent2]]


:: DaeSlaveSS
"Why yes," Tysus nods.  "Black.  Full enclosure, complete with breathing regulation.  Heeled, corseted, plugged.  It must almost be an overwhelming experience, hm?  Now dial up such perceptions, place them in the hands of beings with infinite wisdom, infinite time, and infinite experience torturing slaves just like you."

"Join them?"  Tysus seems liable to scoff at such a suggestion, but after a moment she taps the table between you and her before answering.  "I cannot speak to that.

Their excited yet hushed tones suggest your very public display of submission was helping Torei live up to its infamous reputation.

"Speak to me, cunt."  His voice is gravelly, the cadence strange and accented.  It doesn't sound like any other Torean you have met, nor does it ring any bells within your punctured memories of the galaxy abroad.  Whatever the case may be, you certainly have not started on the right foot.

"Tell me what brings you to me."

He pauses, his mask making it impossible to understand exactly his intent.  Was Petros staring at you?  Could  his eyes be closed in thought?  You have only his words to go on, when he speaks again.

"I will accept this, if you accept my demands.  A contract of submission, as is our ancient ways.  That you are an Offworlder means nothing.  Either you will please me and earn your audience, or more likely you will not and leave me be.  Either way I am satisfied."

He flags down one of the serving girls, who soon returns with a circlet of steel.  A collar.

Moving into the commanded posture, Petros observes you carefully.  Your decision clearly does not invoke his ire, and you make sure to further that by adjusting your posture once kneeling.  Legs spread, back straight, eyes down, hands upon your thighs.

Reaching down, he uses short lengths of chain to link your ankles to your thighs, then your thighs to your wrists.  Once installed, you're effectively forced to remain kneeling.

Much like a shield the thick laminate covering him is held in place by four straps, which he undoes to reveal his cock beneath.

His codpiece had matched the color of his suit, and while his cock is still sheathed in laminate it's of a very different hue-- pure black, an ebony obelisk of considerable length that only grows larger as his gloved hand strokes it, bringing out his full potential.

With Lush's nightly activities in full swing it seems most of the staff is out working the floor however, something you hope will carry forward into the backrooms themselves.

When a passing group of tourists provide a proper bit of cover you break from your position, heading directly for the door.  (if: $Ballet is true)[Your ballet boots make a rapid approach impossible, but you manage as best you can.]  (if: $Plugs is true)[Such effort shifts the plugs sealed inside your lower holes, but you endure, biting down on a bit of a moan.]

[[Reaching the door, you push it open and pass through...->BR3]]


:: BR3
And to your great relief, you do not come face to face with another living soul.  Instead you're greeted with a small antechamber, a glass dispay the only real decoration having been divided into a number of quadrants in which names have been stenciled: Thiva, Sparti, Cherish, among others.  One more name is written in red, unassigned to any of the sections: Akrai.  An arrow drawn from the name leads to a label of "Punishment".

Otherwise the small room is mostly barren, although another door is on the far side of the room.

[[Make for the door.->BRHub]]


:: BRHub
The room that greets you is larger then the antechamber you first entered through, but not by much.  Lockers run along the walls, one of them hanging open revealing a uniform much like those you had seen the bouncers outside the Club wearing.  Presumably this was where they came to store any personal effects while on the job.

More importantly, three doors lead from the room, and these are each labeled.

[[Enter the door to your left, labeled STORAGE.->BRStorage]]
[[Enter the door directly before you, labeled SLAVE QUARTERS.->BRSlaves]]
[[Enter the door to your right, labeled VIP STAIRCASE.->BRVIP]]


:: BRStorage
Exploring the area marked as storage, you're perhaps not unsurprised to find an assortment of supplies for the Club-- all of them neatly labeled.  Most appear to be lights and tablecloths, alongside other decorations capable of transforming Lush into any number of themes.  One area is marked *A Night in Hell*, another *Damsels in Distress* and a third *Polar Expedition.*  

It appears you caught the Club on a rather tame night, all things considered.

[[Return the way you came in.->BRHub]]
[[Check along the bottom shelves.->BRStorageB]]
[[Check along the upper shelves.->BRStorageU]]
[[Examine the posters rolled up in the corner.->BRStorageP]]


:: BRSlaves
You enter into what you quickly recognize must serve as a staging room of sorts, the slaves owned by the club.  Several desks are up against the walls, mirrors atop them surrounded by lights to ease the application or adjustment of makeup, or one's wardrobe.  Larger full length mirrors at each corner provide much the same purporse, as demonstrated by the bottles of *Laminate Shine* you find on nearby tables.  

More labeled doors await you.(if: $BRGag is false)[

The quiet allows you for the first time to hear something, though-- the unmistakable sound of gagged moans from the door to your right.]

[[Take the door to your left, labeled WARDROBE DEVICE.->BRWardrobe]]
[[Take the door directly before you, labeled SLAVE LOUNGE.->BRLounge]]
[[Take the door to your right, labeled CELLS.->BRCells]]
[[Take the door behind you, labeled ENTRANCE.->BRHub]]


:: BRVIP
Less a room and more the landing of a staircase, you can see steps curling upwards-- clearly rising to what had to be a back entrance to the VIP balcony on the floor above!

Unfortunately cage like bars intercede, blocking your path to the staircase proper.  A door allows passage through, but it is closed-- and when your hand tests the handle you find it locked.  That explains the pinpad set directly next to the handle, only a password needed to gain you access to your goal.

(if: $BRVIP is false)[Unfortunately, you have not come across any such password in your explorations.](if: $BRVIP is true)[The code Akrai has given you is fresh in your mind, however-- you need only enter it.]

[[Turn back, the way you came.->BRHub]]
(if: $BRVIP is true)[[[Input the code: 6195->BRVIPGo]]]


:: BRVIPGo
The code Akrai had given you blinks yellow upon the indicator light for a moment, a concerning long moment, but to your great relief it does eventually allow you access.  Pushing through the cell-like door, you close it behind you and begin to accend.  It's neither a hard climb nor all that hard to determine why such a staircase existed-- clearly Lush's slaves occasionally had need to move between the two levels without being observed, or at the very least dealing with the hassle of the patrons on the lower floor.  

A second door meets you at the top, which you slide open carefully-- revealing the balcony overlooking the first floor one way, and a dim hallway the other.  You've made it!

[[Step out.->VIPStart]]


:: BRWardrobe
Entering the room, you come upon a rare thing indeed-- something your amnesia-wracked mind can recognize.  The Wardrobe Device before you looks a bit different then the one you encountered at the Hotel this morning, but the *glass* display built into the front is running on the same operating system from before.  

There are also several cases stacked to the side of the room, their exteriors either a particularly shiny plastic or (more likely) a utilitarian form of laminate.  

[[Approach the Wardrobe Device.->BRWardrobe2]]
[[Examine the cases.->BRCases]]
[[Return to the previous room.->BRSlaves]]


:: BRLounge
Passing through the door marked SLAVE LOUNGE, you enter into what you quickly determine to be the actual living quarters of Lush's slaves.  It's remarkably well furnished, the rather large room having tall vaulted ceilings, a small balcony atop centered on what appeared to be a fireplace of sorts.  Vid-screens and comfortable looking couches occupy the lower floor, along with a kitchenette, separated by an island-like counter of considerable length.

Thankfully the room remains unoccupied, for the time being at least.

:: BRCells
Stepping through the doorway, you find the 'Cells' immediately: roughly a dozen cages, tall enough to stand in and each outfitted with a bed.  These have to be the manner in which Club Lush kept its slaves at night, you imagine, a handful of personal accoutrements decorating each-- alongside a name.  Third on your left, you notice Cherish's cell.

(if: $BRGag is false)[The sounds you had heard are louder here, and its in the furthest cell you see someone moving-- a form of red and black laminate, wriggling to the sound of lurid moans atop the bed which she is strapped to.

Without direction otherwise you wisely default to your temporary Master's pleasure, pressing your tongue up against the bottom of his shaft as your lips suckle around it.  Petros allows it for some time before he finally relents, using his hand upon your head to guide you slowly back off his cock.  There he releases you, as dangerous a proposition as it is liberating.

Now you would need to choose for yourself how best to approach him.

:: BRWardrobe2
*Your search for a means of accessing Club Lush's VIP area have brought you here, deep in the heart of the establishment's slave quarters.  Finding an outfit that matched the uniform you had seen those owned by Lush wearing could undoubtedly be accomplished by a Wardrobe Device such as this.  The ability to easily cycle girls through outfits seemed a likely boon for any such Club, after all.  And with such an outfit you could walk right up into the VIP area.*

(if: $BRKey is false)[Unfortunately stepping up to the machine's control *glass* immediately prompts you with a demand for a "Slave or Management Keycard."

That's something you do not have, locking you out of the device's functions.](if: $BRKey is true)[Stepping up to the machine's control *glass*, you're immediately met with a prompt demanding a "Slave or Management Keycard" for authorization purposes.  Having found one of the *Slave* variety, you simply press the card against the screen-- to which it responds with a cheery ding.]

(if: $BRKey is true)[[[Welcome, User!->BRWardrobe3]]]
[[Step back from the machine.->BRWardrobe]]


:: BRCases
Opening the topmost case you're met with a view of glossy laminate. Pulling forth the first bit your hands seize up reveals it to be a pre-formed outfit, a leotard of cyan so bright as to be almost neon unto itself.  Lacking anything for the legs, the arms would be covered by sleeves.  On the back and framing the peephole opening built into the chest are Club Lush's logo.

You conclude this must one of the relatively rare cases where the Wardrobe Device nearby couldn't easily recreate the oufit, probably due to the particular brightness of the laminate, and as such had been crafted in a more traditional manner and then shipped in.  

[[Search through another of the cases.->BRCase2]]
[[Step back from the cases.->BRWardrobe]]


:: BRWardrobe3
A splash of color slides across the screen, and with it comes unbridled access to the Wardrobe Device.  Unlike the machine you utilized at the hotel, this one appears to have full access to a potential inventory of outfits several thousand pages long.  Luckily for you, however, the uniform you're looking for is highlighted as the very first entry.

Selecting it prompts for biometrics, namely a scan of your eye.

[[Lean in and let it scan.->BRWardrobe4]]
[[Step back.  Let me think about this.->BRWardrobe2]]


:: BRCase2
The second case is a set of accessories, the coloration matching the bright cyan of the first.  Cuffs, belts, gags and the like.

[[Search through another of the cases.->BRCase3]]
[[Step back from the cases.->BRWardrobe]]


:: BRCase3
Opening another case reveals it full of boots, all of them heeled-- although several simply feature the raised profile, lacking a heel itself.  

If you remember correctly, those were often called gravity heels.

[[Dig through this case.->BRCase5]]
[[Step back from the cases.->BRWardrobe]]


:: Neg17Tease
Instead of immediately returning his cock to your throat, you instead shift your head to approach slightly off-center.  Pressing your lips against his member, you kiss the laminate-coated shaft, teasing it as your tongue emerges afterward, wrapping around as much as it could.

Above you Petros grunts a bit, perhaps surprised.  He certainly approves, as indicated by the way he nods.  "Good slave."

[[Take him into your mouth again, quickly.->Neg17Fail]]
[[Take him into your mouth again, slowly.->Neg17Slow]]


:: Neg17Fail
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)Your enthusiasm is immediately noted by the male reigning above you, but his hand intercedes, halting you halfway up his shaft.  "No."  That you had chosen poorly is indicated by the way his mask shakes back and forth, and he forces you back off his cock.  "There is no grace in this."

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)[He releases you.  "Slower."

[[Use your lips to gently tease his member.->Neg17Tease]]
[[Take him into your mouth again, slowly.->Neg17Slow]]]


:: Neg17Slow
Slowly, carefully, you move to return Petros' cock to your throat.  Without his guiding hand to all but force you it's almost an entirely different experience the second time, the decision to accept such degrading treament utterly yours alone to make.  And you do make it, pressing your head forward, taking his manhood into your mouth until you're all but choking on it.

The Torean Master watches you intently, the bondage you're in maintaining your posture so that he need only focus solely on the work of your lips and tongue.  He seemed a particularly conservative sort, even by Torean standards-- perhaps that explained his fascination with your technique.  Was this story, the woman upon her knees serving a Master, as old as Torei itself?

[[Slowly you pull back out.->Neg18]]


:: Neg18
Having made your first stroke of your own accord, you now try to settle on a pace that would please the man.  On one hand, eagerness in submission seemed oft rewarded on this planet.  On the other, he seemed inclined to prefer a slower-- more sensual approach.

The only thing you are sure of is that you don't have long to decide-- already his hand reaches out, intending to guide you back to him.

[[Keep it very slow.  Really tease him.->Neg19Tease]]
[[Keep it slow, work him over carefully.->Neg19Slow]]
[[Keep it brisk, you don't want to bore him.->Neg19Brisk]]
[[Take him as hard as you can, like the fucktoy you are.->Neg19Fast]]


:: Neg19Tease
You decide upon a truly *slow* approach, often breaking from your stroking motions along his cock to kiss the shaft, or to play with his balls with your tongue upon hilting upon him completely.  It's a choice he allows, observing you carefully as you ever so slowly edge him towards climax.
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)
Yet it is not an experience he allows to go on as long as you intended.  Your reverie is broken by his hand once more landing upon your (if: $Slave is true)[laminated hooded head](else:)[head, painfully grabbing you by the hair.]

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)["Do you think me another slave, to tease in this manner?  You are not my soubrette, slave."

You decide upon a *slow* approach, keeping your lips formally upon his cock with each backstroke, but moving at a careful, languid pace.  It's a choice he allows, observing you carefully as you ever so slowly edge him towards climax.
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)

:: Neg19Brisk
You decide upon a brisk approach, keeping your lips upon his cock with every backstroke so as to almost immediately proceed into the next.  It's a choice he allows, observing you carefully as you ever so slowly edge him towards climax.

It's a pace that seems to meet his approval, the occasional grunt of pleasure from the mask even suggesting a quickly growing arousal.  In fact it seems to grow at such a rate that he eventually outpaces you, his hand once more landing upon your (if: $Slave is true)[laminated hooded head](else:)[head, painfully grabbing you by the hair.]  His next command is dreadfully simple.

"Faster."

[[You try to keep up.->Neg20]]


:: Neg19Fast
You decide upon a truly aggressive approach, driving back down upon his cock as soon as you manage to reach the apex of each backstroke.  Unable to resist the wanton desire to feel his manhood deep inside your mouth, you almost miss his hand landing upon your (if: $Slave is true)[laminated hooded head](else:)[head, painfully grabbing you by the hair.]
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)
"This does not please me," he declares, matter of factly.  "I am not surprised you are such a whore, but this lacks grace.  And skill.  You could go *faster*."

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)[Just what *that* meant is explained by the plunging of your head forward, back onto his cock, as he begins to drive you faster and faster-- soon outpacing your own self-set pace...

[[[You try to keep up.->Neg20]]]]


:: Neg20
His second hand lands upon your head moments later, providing the control needed to direct your ministrations at a truly aggressive pace.  He gives you no time to pause after each stroke, nor even to truly breathe-- you're merely forced back down upon the laminate shaft, its glossy material gliding across your tongue until it presses against the back of your throat.

It's an experience that is quickly tiring, even as the Master above growls with pleasure.  Petros was clearly enjoying himself, but honestly you're not sure how long you can keep this up.

(if: $Plugs is true)[And it's at that moment you feel your plugs shifting to life between your legs.

:: NegPlugged
You may have accepted the promise of the plugs sealed inside your cunt and rear being activated at random, but they could not have chose a worse time to do so.  Thankfully you're bound, as without the restraints you very well may have fallen over, the sensation of them purring to life as surprising as it was pleasurable.  

Petros had noticed your plugs during the earlier inspection, and he seems to notice what you're undergoing now-- undoubtedly that saves you from his displeasure, something like a chuckle even escaping his mask.

"Now all three holes are at work, slave?"

And indeed, the male does not relent even as your thighs shift back and forth a bit, seeking to further the pleasure even as you try to focus on your oral work again.

[[Try to ask him to slow!->Neg21Slow]]
[[Pull against his hands, to get him to slow!->Neg21Pull]]

:: Neg21Slow
"Mmmmgghhhh..." With your lips wrapped around his cock, its the best you can manage, and clearly not enough.  Not only are you ignored, it almost feels as if Petros increases his almost furious pace even further, to punish you for such a transgression.

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)[There is little you can do but endure, to focus on your breathing as the strokes of your mouth upon his manhood begin to blur together.  In and out, in and out...

With both his hands upon your head, you have absolutely zero chance of forcing a halt to proceedings at this point-- which the male clearly intended to continue upon.  Not only are you ignored, it almost feels as if Petros increases his almost furious pace even further, to punish you for such a transgression.

:: Neg21Race
Doubting in your own ability to halt the assault, you instead attempt to quicken your own despoilation-- sucking hard, moving with his harsh guidance, forcing him further and further towards climax.

It's a well founded strategy, and one Petros seems to recognize-- he growls with pleasure as you push him faster, yet the Master demonstrates his own experience by only speeding up, going beyond what was already a furious pace.  In the end you can do little but focus on your breathing as the strokes begin to blur together. 

In and out, in and out...

[[...in and out...->Neg22]]


:: Neg22
The effort is so all consuming you're taken by utter surprise when Petros' rough guidance suddenly holds you still-- his manhood fully within your mouth as he groans in a rare display of ecstasy.  The taste of something foreign being spurted down your throat follows, a moment's realization needed to recognize what could only be his cum.  (if: $Plugs is true)[As if taking the cue, the dildos in your cunt and rear seem to double down, pushing you towards a similar and thus simultaneous climax.

Moments later Master Petros begins to cum.

[[Swallow!->Neg23Swallow]]


:: Neg23Swallow
Grunting with ecstasy, Petros begins to cum, his manhood quivering in your mouth as his seed runs down your throat.  It's a sensation you seek to further, swallowing as quickly as you can to keep up with a flow that could only be described as prodigious.

Somewhere along the way he begins backing out of you, and to your credit you maintain your dedication, not allowing one drop of his seed to spill.  It's a result that earns his satisfaction, demonstrated by yet another nod from his masked visage.  Reaching down afterward, he runs a gloved hand across his own member before holding it to your face.

"Lick it clean."

[[Clean away his cum and your own saliva.->Neg24]]


:: Neg23Fail
Having devoted yourself to pleasure, you fail to focus on your swallowing-- and thus feel the Master's cum filling your mouth even as he begins to back out from your full lips.  When he finally exits a rather large portion follows, running down your chin and onto your breasts.
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)
Above, breathing heavily through his mask, Petros finds a bit of rage for his voice despite the afterglow.  "Slaves always swallow, slut.  Always."

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)[Reaching down, he works his gloved hand around his cock, wiping clean the member even as he presents the hand to your face.

As you work your tongue even further, pressing it between the smooth laminate digits that made up his hand, Petros uses his other limb to begin unlocking your restraints.  Unhooking one end of each of the connecting chains, for the moment he lets them hang loosely from your body, the added cuffs remaining as well.

Only then does he take a seat back on the couch nearby, his obsidian phallus still boldly erect as he leans back, breathing deeply.  After a few moments he gestures vaguely your way.

"Bourbon.  The bartender knows which."

Apparently he wanted you to head for the bar, still wearing your restraints, his cum still on your lips.

[["M-Master...?->Neg25Fail]]
[[Stand and make the walk to the bar.->Neg25]]


:: Neg25Fail
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)You cannot tell it, but its not hard to imagine his eyes closed in the afterflow of your encounter-- until one opens, piercing in its severity.

"Do you not still wear my collar?  I did not give you leave to speak."

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)[Indeed, the metal band around your throat remains.  Looks like you don't have much of a choice.

[[Stand and make the walk to the bar.->Neg25]]]


:: Neg25
Standing, you make your way across Club Lush, the bar being far on the opposite side.  Were this any other planet, it would have been quite the walk of shame indeed.  Wrapped in glossy laminate, your every curve on display, the chains still linking Petros' cuffs upon your body jingle with every step, sinister bells with far more devious intent.  The efforts of your service to the male are evident to anyone who happens to glance your way, your breasts rising and falling (if: $Brand is true or $Slave is true)[atop your tightly corseted waist  ]while a bit of his seed still runs down your chin until you wipe it clean with a back of your hand.

But this is Torei, and you're merely a collared woman.  Excepting the tourists who gawked at most anything, this is very much your expected place.  

The bartender certainly seems to think so, his noticing of you rather far apart from when he actually approaches.  By the time he does you're glancing back towards Petros, concerned he may grow impatient.

Placing a small tray upon the bar, he leans over it to meet your gaze.  "What does your owner need, slave?"

[["I'm not a slave!"->NegNotSlave]]
[["What took you so long?"->NegWhyLong]]
[["Master Petros requested a bourbon.  He said you would know which."->Neg26]]

"Temporary indentured servant is quite the mouthful," the bartender replies, with a casual smile.  Even so, he's quick to correct you on one measure.

"And you best learn to keep your eyes down when wearing a collar like that.  Now-- what does your owner need?"

[["What took you so long to take my order?"->NegWhyLong]]

"Simple etiquette," the bartender shrugs, with an easy smile.  "Masters first, then freewombs, then girls like you."

He waggles a finger to his own throat, indicating Petros' collar.

"Anyway," he continues, "what does your owner want?"

[["I'm not a slave!"->NegNotSlave]]

"That I do know," the bartender replies, reaching below.  "Starlight Black.  For one Torean bred and born, he sure does enjoy tastes of the galaxy beyond, hmm?"

He winks, setting the glass of bourbon on the small tray.  Could you not be described in much the same manner?

[["What's with the tray?"->Neg27Tray]]
[[Take the tray, and make your way back.->Neg27]]

"It's customary for girls in your position to present things with a bit of flair, of course.  Never done it before?  When you get back to him, kneel to his side-- not before him-- and the tray before you-- chest level, not above your head."  

Given Petros' focus on etiquette, that would be good to know.

Crossing the Club a second time, tray held before you, is a quick enough affair.  (if: $Ballet is true)[Your ballet boots make it quite the trying effort, however, the necessities of maintaining your balance in such footwear nearly sending the bourbon to an early demise upon the floor.

As he had upon first meeting, Petros ignores you entirely-- except to snap his fingers to the side of his seat and not before it.

"Etiquette demands a slave not address her Master directly, nor stand in his presence."

:: Neg28Side
Approaching the side of your (temporary) Master, you kneel beside him, tray held in your hands.  The arm of his couch appears well suited for such an implement, or you can merely hold it yourself.

[[Hold the tray at chest level before you.->Neg29]]
[[Hold the tray above your head.->Neg29Above]]
[[Place the tray upon the couch's arm, close to Petros.->Neg29Arm]]

(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)[[[Shit.  Move to his side and kneel.->Neg28Side]]]


:: Neg29
Holding the tray smartly, just below your breasts, you wait for the Master to deign to notice you.  And it does indeed take some time, although he eventually turns, taking the glass with a careful hand.

"Etiquette does not demand any further direct service from you," he notes solemnly.

"But it does demand you return yourself to a fit state."  He offers you a key.  "For the cuffs.(if: $Slave is true)[  And you will return yourself to breath regulation.
[[You take up your regulating gasmask again.->NegMask]]]"

[[Unlock yourself.->Neg30]]


:: Neg29Above
Keeping the tray above your head may have been the most dramatic posture possible, but it quickly proves difficult to hold-- your arms ill-suited for balancing the tray so far above you like that.  Just before it can end in disaster, however, Petros swipes the drink.
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)
(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)["Etiquette does not demand you endanger my drink," he notes solemnly.

[[You take up your regulating gasmask again.->NegMask]]]"

[[Unlock yourself.->Neg30]]]


:: Neg29Arm
Sliding the tray upon the arm of the sofa, its quickly apparent that Petros disapproves.  He swipes the drink from it with an almost feral alacrity, then looks sharply your way.
(set: $PetrosA to it - 1)
(if: $PetrosA is < -3)[[[You appear to reached the end of Petros' patience.->PetrosFail2]]](else:)["Etiquette does not demand you end such a performance with laziness," he notes solemnly.

[[You take up your regulating gasmask again.->NegMask]]]"

[[Unlock yourself.->Neg30]]]


:: NegMask
Picking up your laminate mask, you hold it before you momentarily-- enjoying one last breath of free air-- before sliding it back into place upon your head.  It takes a bit to seat it properly, but eventually you find yourself looking out a familiar panel of glass, your breathing becoming audible as the restraint filters kick into gear.  It's as difficult to bear as you remember, and more then a little bit arousing.  

Few, after all, submitted willingly to the uniform you again wear in full.

[[You turn to your cuffs.->Neg30]]


:: Neg30
Pulling off the restraints Petros had provided, you quickly realize the collar itself did not respond to the key provided.

"You will have your audience first," he declares, noticing your confusion.  "And in this way, you will remember your place."

He indicates the floor directly before him.  "You will kneel, in proper posture, and beg for that which you have earned."

[[You know the drill now.  Legs spread, back straight, eyes down...->Neg31]]


:: Neg31
You move to a position directly before the seated Master, spreading your legs and straightening your back-- and when prompted, explain that you seek access from him to the VIP section of the Club.  It's a request he considers for a only a moment, the effort you put in to earn that moment intensive, the actual work required of him to sate it insignificant.  Thus was the Torean way.

"These were the terms negotiated, I suppose.  And I hardly care for the VIP area, not when the floor down here is so full of ambition and desperation.  If this boon is truly what you seek, I will grant it.  At your leisure, you may tell the guard near the stairs that you have my sponsorship, so to speak."

[["Thank you, Master!"->Neg32]]
[["This will suit me, Master."->Neg32]]
[["Was there anything else you needed, Master?"->Neg32]]


:: Neg32
Reaching forward, at Petros' touch the collar he had affixed to your throat comes undone.  His power over you suspended, he seems to rapidly lose interest, swirling his still untasted drink while flicking his hand towards the VIP staircase.
(set: $PetrosTry to true)
"You will leave me."

[[Rising from your kneeling position, you step away.->Neg33]]


:: Neg33
Moving away from the male, you look back on an experience you could only describe as intensely degrading-- the submission required of you so complete as to be distinctly Torean.  You may still have your own goals, your own motivations, but in that moment it's impossible to ignore the simple fact that Torei had placed its indelible mark upon your soul.  

Would it all prove worth it?  It seems you could now go and see.  With Petros' sponsorship, the stairs that ascended to the VIP section should be opened-- and with it, finally, the meeting you had tracked all this way and endured so much to reach.  

*Now if only you could remember what it was truly for.*

[[You make your way back to your table, to take stock.->LushHub]]


:: BRCase5
You hardly find anything remarkable.  Just more shoes.  Given that the cases were sealed and clearly well sorted, perhaps that shouldn't have been unexpected.

Whatvever you were so intent on searching for isn't here, at least.

[[Step back from the cases.->BRWardrobe]]


:: BRStorageB
The bottom shelves are filled with extra glasses and liquor, the latter occupying several heavy duty laminate crates.  Given Lush's large bar, and its distinct collection of intoxicants both Torean and Offworld-originating, its perhaps no small wonder they kept a extra stock back here.

Beyond that, you don't see much of interest.

[[Step back.->BRStorage]]


:: BRStorageU
The upper rows of the storage area are filled with several devices you immediately recognize as having a very *carnal* intent.  Most appear to feature different means of interacting with the female anatomy, be it via vibrating nubs, plunging phalli, or in one particular case something that looks like a pulley lined with metallic tabs-- to which purpose you can only imagine.

Lush's slaves apparently had their work cut out for them, on occasion.

[[Step back.->BRStorage]]


:: BRStorageP
Several posters, larger then you are tall even with the added height of your heels, are collected in the storage room's corner.  Moving to unfurl the first, if only to sate your idle curiosity, its then you notice something else behind the posters.  Pushing them aside takes a good moment, but when you do you're rewarded with an unexpected sight: a door, obviously hidden.  Just where it went is impossible to determine, the portal lacking any manner of view beyond it.  You do however find something else jammed into the doorframe itself, a small folding blade.  Given its position, it almost looked like someone had been trying to pry the door open.  It doesn't appear they succeeded, and you see no other way of opening it.

(if: $BRGag is true)[(set: $BRCut to true)The blade is small, but appears to be exactly the sort needed to cut through the laminate restraints holding Akrai.  You decide to take it with you.]

[[Step back.->BRStorage]]


:: VIPStart
You've made it.  Despite everything you've endured, at the hotel, on the Torean streets, and inside this very Club-- your goal is now merely a few steps away.  *The deal.*  You don't remember the terms, but from what you've collected together it simply **must** be worth all the effort.  Torei was a land of strange wonders, after all, and you're still a prospector.  If you could just chip off a bit of the collected cultural wealth of this planet, enough to run with to the stars, you would be set for life.  

Taking a deep breath, you move across the balcony towards the darkened hallway beyond.  Neon labels upon each door chart your path through the desolate sea, until you come upon the island of light that Cherish had mentioned upon your entering-- VIP Suite #4.  

[[Knock.->VIP2]]


:: BRLoungeFire
Ascending the stairs, you soon find yourself in a cozy little fireplace nook, overlooking the rest of the living area.  The fire itself is not lit, but even so its not hard to imagine Lush's slaves seated her early in the morning-- given their undoubtedly all-night work in the club proper-- winding down.

[[That's enough up here, head back downstairs.->BRLounge]]


:: BRLoungeKitchen
Approaching the kitchen, you move between the island counter and appliances along the wall.  Peeking inside the icebox reveals it to be well stocked, a fact that is perhaps a bit surprising given how slaves on Torei were generally treated.  Perhaps it served as a perk?  You're certainly hungry enough to consider it a proper proposition, but cannot sate that desire now-- someone could still walk in at any moment, and you're here for a reason after all.

Otherwise the area is relatively unremarkable.

[[Step back.->BRLounge]]


:: BRLoungeScreens
The seating area you approach seems comfortable enough, but its the vid screen on the wall that draws your attention.  Simply put-- its massive, the anchor points at each corner further apart then your armspan.  Resting on the coffee table nearby is a remote.

[[Step back.->BRLounge]]

Each accessory across her body, corset and collar, cuffs and gloves, providing a darker contrast by being completely black.  She's moaning into the band pulled across her mouth, but rising above even that sound is the constant purr of what could only be multiple vibrators locked within her glistening suit.

A quick examination reveals the majority of her restraints securely anchored, but her gag at least lacks locks-- likely a utilitarian decision, making communication with her captors available at their will.  As it stands, however, she is very much helpless before *you.*](if: $BRGag is true)[Strapped securely to the bed, Akrai remains covered from head to toe in a dark red catsuit, struggling against her restraints.

:: BRTV
Instead of defaulting to any particular channel, this vid screen instead brings you to a long listing of available stations.  There appear to be two groups, one containing the standard looking variety of programs, the other labeled "Antipodal Longwave".

:: BRTVNews
The topmost news channel is labeled as "TNN", and its to that you tune.
 
 Greeting you, a primly dressed woman in glossy red laminate smiles into the camera, a collar pulled tight around her throat boldly proclaiming her to be 'Property of TNN'.

"Welcome back to the Torean News Network," she greets, as bright and chipper as her outfit.  "As always, my name is Anna Karis and these are your top stories for the Ringdom of Aekora."

She shuffles the thinprint laminate sheets on the desk before her.  "Offworld-born pop star Reya Tianna shocked fans today by revealing that she had accepted a collar, and will be retiring from public performances to fulfill its obligations.  Tianna has not revealed the name of her new owner, and speculation runs rampant as for her reasoning for entering into service, but many have been quick to point with the singer's twice extended stay on Torei and images of her from earlier this month in strict bondage indicating what could be a sincere desire for enslavement."

The newswoman smiles.  "Offworlder protests have been reported as fierce, but when pressed for comment local officials have confirmed the legitimacy of Miss Tianna's right to servitude, a proud Torean cultural heritage and institution."

:: BRTVSports
You flip to a sports channel, only to find a particularly archaic sport being practiced: chariot racing.  It takes a moment, but with a bit of shock you finally realize what made it so very Torean.  Instead of horses, or other creatures of burden, each chariot is instead pulled by a team of six women-- ponygirls-- each team of them wearing the same brightly colored laminate beneath their tack and harness.  Given the cloven heels each are wearing you're surprised to see them maintaining a full sprint easily, although the way their drivers lash them mercilessly from on high explains their motivation.  

As you watch a team crosses the finishline, breaking a laminate band stretched across the field.  They're met with furious applause and cheering from the stands as the camera rushes towards the driver for what soon becomes a post-race interview.  Of the panting, moaning women locked together nearby little attention is given.

:: BRTVLongwave
Unlike the other channels, which come in with perfect clarity, this one struggles a bit with an absolutely ancient issue: static.  Given the reference to longwave, you conclude this particular channel has to be coming in from far away, perhaps bounced off the atmosphere from the other side of the planet.

If the channel itself is ancient, the program playing is almost beyond time itself.  It appears to document a mother and daughter's fictionalized life on a homestead in what's referred to as the 'Lichen Belt', an area depicted as mostly desolate.  What's most shocking however are the slaves, many included in the background almost as an afterthought-- one baking in the kitchen, another locked spread-eagled to the wall of the family's home, two more distantly pulling a plow in the fields.

If this was a view of rural Torei, it seemed the ease of obtaining slaves applied even there.

:: BRTVWU
Instead of a regular channel, this one is merely a mostly static table, depicting the incoming and outgoing schedule for the Way Up-- Torei's lone space elevator.  You remember only snippets of your last ride on the elevator, but you do get a sense that the passenger carriage was quite large-- a fact confirmed by the relative rarity of departures and arrivals noted on the screen.  It appears the most recent arrival was about an hour ago, and far more relevent to your concerns, a midnight ride going up is listed, corresponding with the ticket you found at the hotel this morning.

Despite everything, its still on time, and *you* still have the time to make it.  The opportunity for escape remains open.

:: BRUpMag
Titled *Thrall's Ball*, the magazine appears to be focused on high fashion couture.  Bright, glossy photoshoots fill equally glossy pages, a moment's examination confirming how very Torean of a publication it is: even the material of the pages themselves is laminate thinprint.  Flipping through several pages reveals an examination of upcoming fashion lines, the current fad being based around exclusivity.   Instead of being freely available from Wardrobe devices, it appears most of the current designs must be special ordered preformed.

An interesting read, but of little use to you otherwise.

[[Step back.->BRLoungeFire]]


:: BRUpSit
Deep into your search, you throw a bit of caution to the wind, and sit down upon one of the plushy seats.  Just a moments rest, to get you off your heels for a moment(if: $Plugs is true)[-- although the movement shifts the plugs buried within you, distracting from any true sense of relaxation or relief].  Yet even as you settle in, something jabs you in the laminate covering your thigh.  Reaching down to find the perpetrator, your (if: $Sec is false)[gloved ] hand comes back up with what you very quickly realize is a keycard!
(set: $BRKey to true)
Examining the card, it has two words written along the top: SLAVE and MANAGEMENT.  The latter, management, is crossed off however.  Along the back is a warning, noting its authorized for "Wardrobe use only", as well as providing a warning to not misplace the card.  Clearly someone had failed to heed that last bit.

You had originally came back here to find an outfit to allow you to slip upstairs, and this seemed to be your literal key to achieve that goal-- you keep the card with you as you stand again.

[[And then you step back.->BRLoungeFire]]


:: BRUpCuffs
The glint of metal had caught your eye, and moving towards the far end of the seating area you reach down-- pulling for a pair of discarded cuffs, a short length of shiny chain running between them.  Despite the quiet civility of the room, its a stark reminder of Torei's culture of bondage and hierarchy.  It was always there, really-- just waiting for someone like you to stumble.

[[Step back.  Carefully.->BRLoungeFire]]


:: BRUpUp
Moving to the railing, you are given a nearly bird's eye view of the slave quarters.  If you were hoping for a particularly insightful revelation, or for keen eyes to spot anything in particular however-- you're sorely mistaken.  At the very least no one else has wandered in yet, which given your luck on Torei day is more than just a small blessing.

[[Step back.->BRLoungeFire]]


:: BRAkraiRemove
When your hands upon the gagging belt are first felt by the pinned woman she visibly starts, as if trying to shy away from hands she could only imagine were not friendly.  You persist anyway, and as you had observed her gag is relatively easy to remove.  The bound woman exerts herself immediately.
(set: $BRGag to true)
"You don't *feel* like the Master, or one of his people.  What's going on?  Who are you?"

She's trying desperately to downplay the desire that runs behind every word, even as her hips thrust impotently against her bindings.

[["Who I am doesn't matter."->BRAkraiNo]]
[["I was wondering what... you're doing?"->BRAkraiWhat]]
[["I want your help."->BRAkraiHelp]]


:: BRAkraiFreed
"T-Thank.. thank the Princess Thrall," she all but moans.  "Hurry, please.  Then I'll tell you whatever you like.  Promise."

The laminate holding her to the bed is thick, and surprisingly resistant to your efforts, but the blade proves sharp enough.  One by one you cut through the bands holding Akrai, until at last she rises.

"My blade," she asks for, holding out a hand.  You give it to her, allowing the woman to reach up-- delicately cutting away the blindfold that had been keeping her blind.  The eyes that are revealed are bright and intelligent, looking you over quickly.

"(if: $Blue is true)[Not what I expected.  Someone wearing that many cuffs, I mean.  Like the blue color though.](if: $Smoke is true)[Not what I expected.

Nevermind.]"  Still the sound of her vibrators intrude, and without restraints one of her gloved hands falls to the space between her legs, but steel lock on the zipper there prevents access- and her knife couldn't cut through that.  Either way, she tries to ignore it by focusing on you.  "I guess its my turn to fulfill the deal, right?"
(if: $Wet is true)[
She wiggles her knife your way.  "As a bonus, I can cut those bands off your thighs.  Unless you *want* to be announcing that to everyone..."

"What!?"  The shock is as evident in Akrai's body language as the frustrated ecstasy is.  "P-Please... you can't, I'll tell you whatever you want!  Just like I promised I would!  Don't leave me like this!"

"Someone... new?  An intruder?  Is that you, Perei-- fucking with me?"  She was right on one of those guesses, but doesn't give you the time to point that out before continuing.

"The gate..." it takes her a moment to understand what you mean, the loud sound of her vibrators undoubtedly muddling her thoughts a bit, but she pulls through.  "The VIP gate-- r-right.  Well you're in luck, I know the code.  We all do, the slaves here I mean..."

Again she pauses, whimpering as much as moaning as she struggles in her bondage.  "So we h-have a deal, right?  You'll need to find something to free me.  I doubt M-Master left a key just laying around, so maybe a knife... oh, *my* knife... so you can cut me loose.  Then I'll tell you the passcode, or whatever else you want."

"Well, whatever-- you would need to use our wardrobe machine, which means you would need a key... I can help with that."

Again she pauses, whimpering as much as moaning as she struggles in her bondage.  "So we h-have a deal, right?  You'll need to find something to free me.  I doubt M-Master left *his* key just laying around, so maybe a knife... oh, *my* knife... so you can cut me loose.  Then I'll tell you where to find a Wardrobe pass, or whatever else you want."

"I... tried to run away," she admits, sounding ashamed.  "I just c-couldn't stand it... being collared, trained, then s-sold to Master.  I haven't been here long, so first chance I got... I ran."

Akrai grits her teeth, quivering towards another orgasm that never comes to her. The frustration that follows is evident, her back arching despite her corset.  "Didn't make it f-far, obviously... and then Master put me on d-denial punishment... I think its been days."

Instead of moaning in ecstasy, or crying-- you can't tell which-- she instead tries to focus.  "Do we have a deal?"

"G-Good enough..." she sighs, although its impossible to tell if its because of what you said or a slight change in her vibrator's roaring assault.  Settling back into her restraints, as best she can, Akrai dismisses you.

(set: $Wet to false)"Thought so," Akrai replies, coming closer.  "Here.  Hold still, won't take but a moment."

She's true to her word, the thin blade sliding almost effortlessly between the laminate of your thigh and the band atop it.  Cutting it free, she then repeats the prcoess on the other.

"There," the slave concludes.  "Now, like I said, that was a bonus.  What do you want from me, in return for releasing me?"

From a dozen places along the Wardrobe's walls, metallic arms emerge to seize you.  Your words as well as whatever resistance you could muster are ignored, the machine rapidly seizing control.  Locking around your wrists and ankles, waist and throat, it quickly forces you into a position with legs spread and arms held out to your sides.

*Stripping process intialized.*

Just what *that* meant is soon clarified, as a ring descends from above, spraying every inch of your body coated with laminate.  Whatever it was doing, the effect is immediate, your formally glossy material dulling then beginning to run down your body into the drain below.  Those parts that were reinforced with metal or other accessories are caught as they collapse, being stored within the machine as it makes a second pass, cleaning off any lingering residue with a violet glow that leaves you as utterly naked.

Chiming happily, the Wardrobe changes modes.

*Piercing process initalized.*

With its myriad arms still holding you spread-eagled and helpless, different-- far more distressing devices emerge from the Wardrobe's hidden alcoves.  The first approach your breasts, now so very exposed.

(if: $Pierced is true)[There they find your nipples already pierced, a fact that seems to please the machine as it moves downward, focusing elsewhere.](if: $Pierced is false)[There they maneuver up against your nipples, pressing a cold tip up against them to make them hard before long needles line up.  You're not even given a chance to flinch before the piercing apparatus drives home in unison, neatly adorning you with metal studs in each nipple.  Afterward a new arm moves in to apply a healing solution, a modern medical miracle of strictly Torean origin, even as the piercing arm moves downward.(set: $Pierced to true)]

There it lines up before your womanhood, and most concerningly... your clit.

[["No!"->BRWardrobe9]]
[["Please!"->BRWardrobe9]]
[[Silently endure.->BRWardrobe9]]


:: BRWardFail [Debt]
You pull against the restraining arms, success welling in your chest as the armature on your left wrist cracks audibly,

This *can* be escaped!

If not for the arm behind you, waiting silently.  You do not see it, but you certainly *feel* the sudden snap of electricty that bursts upon your rear, pain receptors announcing the experience with a unified yelp that matches the sound that emerges from your own lips.

*REMAIN STILL.*

The display changed to deliver the command, the cold steel of what you can only imagine to be a cattle prod still poised against her buttocks.  You take a deep breath... and settle back as the arm restraint returns.

*Minor damage has been recorded to Arm 5-L-6. A 100 credit charge has been made to your account.*
(set: $debt to it - 100)
[[The piercing process resumes.->BRWardrobe8]]


:: BRWardrobe9
The Wardrobe matters not for your reactions.  It had a blueprint to follow, and in those plans your uniform required a clit piercing.  Such clinical professionalism from the machine doesn't help with the sharp spike of pain that comes with the installation of your ring, but the salve it applies afterward does provide release.  And there the Wardrobe pauses, allowing you to accustom yourself to such a humiliating alteration.

But it doesn't stop there.

*Testing 'punishment shock' mode in 3... 2... 1...*

[[Wait, wha-->BRWardrobe10]]


:: BRWardrobe10
The pain that radiates from your most sensative of nubs is perhaps best described as *lancing*, riding straight up your nerves to some primal reactionary part of the brain that cried for immediate mercy.  You writhe in impotent distress for as long as the pulse of electricity is discharged through you-- by empirical observation a few seconds, but for what feels like an eternity.  

Finally, however, it ceases.  You're left in the wake, moaning softly in your restraints.  Yet the Wardrobe is hardly done yet.

*Testing 'pleasure reward' mode in 3... 2... 1...*

[[Grit your teeth.->BRWardrobe11]]

The second test is much like the first, emanating from your clit in a wave of sensation more akin to directly tapping your nervous system then anything  else you've ever felt.  This one however is sheer, unbridled euphoria.  Igniting a fire between your legs, then pouring gasoline upon it until it blazed-- all but out of control.

But it too ends, suddenly, too suddenly.  Instinctively you drive your hips out, seeking more, anything to fuel that fire already fluttering.  The futility of the maneuver is clear, however.  You're left unsatisfied, frustrated, and more then a little humiliated.  The Wardrobe chimes in response.

*Testing successful.  Starting uniform application...*

[[It continues.->BRWardrobe12]]

As this new step engages, the large ring ascends from where it had halted below.  This time instead of dissolving an outfit, it applies it, utilizing a swarm of small nozzles mounted on armatures.  Powder blue stockings are formed around your feet, then ankles, calves, and thighs.  At their top it provides a decoratory white band before progressing into garters that are ran up even further.  A garter belt and panties are formed, both stark white in coloration, before the Wardrobe begins on the main piece of your new uniform.

What becomes your bodice and skirt is carefully formed as a singular piece, from your shoulders down to the decorative faux-belt at your waist.  From there it expands, careful pleating created alongside a ruffled petticoat the skirt itself *just* fails to cover.  Indeed the entire ensemble is quite short, exposing the meeting of your thighs and thus the panties there with even the barest of movements.  With the application of your sleeves, the shoulders ruffled while the arms are tight leading to white gloves, the Wardrobe then shifts to accessories.

High-heeled pumps are extruded from the floor, immediately forcing you onto your toes while providing a considerable height addition-- the platforms are quite large.  Further up a decorate collar is built around your throat, the blue laminate serving as a choker while also featuring ornamental folds to each side.  Final additions come in the form of a small headpiece, a fascinator marked with Club Lush's logo upon the button near its center, and a pair of glasses.  The red frames provide a splash of alternative color, but do nothing for your sight.

[["Is it.. over?"->BRWardrobe13]]
[[Hang limply.->BRWardrobe13]]


:: BRWardrobe13
One final piece awaits.  The printing ring completes its path by rising above you, recessing in the Wardrobe's ceiling as every other armature retreats-- save one that instead emerges, gripping a thin band of metal.  Built of simple stainless steel, what you quickly identify as a proper slave's collar is aligned with your throat then pressed against it.  The band is installed over the innermost portion of your decorative laminate choker, emerging to visiblity between the folds that flank each side.  

It's impossible to miss the sharp report of the collar's lock clicking closed.

[[Dressing complete.->BRWardrobe14]]


:: BRWardrobe14
Carefully, the restraining arms begin to release you.  One by one your liberty is restored until you stand alone within the Wardrobe, atop your freshly formed platform heels.  Even the barest movement of your hips shifts your shirt, flaring it suggestively given the length (or lack thereof).  Worse, the same movement allows you to feel the pull of your panties against the ring now piercing your clitoris. 

*Dressing sequence completed.*
(set: $Status to 3)
You emerge from the Wardrobe unequivocally changed.  Your outfit is different of course, but so is your body, modified with steel to augment and control your sensuality.  And there is the collar of course, your ID card being returned to you upon exit.  FREEWOMB is still labeled along the top, but over it fresh black ink has been applied, spelling our your new status.

**SLAVE**

You're not even sure to *whom*.  Probably whoever owned Lush.  Hopefully, if everything went to plan however, it wouldn't particularly matter.  You now have the means to slip past that bouncer at the VIP stairs, to make your appointment.  Play this right, and you should be able to simply leave the Club afterward-- and make for the Way Up.  By this time tomorrow you could very well be safe in the space station on the far end of the elevator, where Torei's laws did not apply.

[[Hopefully it would all be worth it.->BRWardrobe15]]


:: BRWardrobe15
Backtracking through Lush's restricted areas, you work on growing accustomed to your new outfit.  Especially the footwear.  Since your dressing this morning you've been forced into heels, but the platforms on these are a new experience, requiring an adjustment to your gait that takes a bit of practice.  But you manage, even making it look natural as you push through the final door and emerge back out into the Club proper-- next to the stage.

There you pause, taking a moment to observe.  Thankfully, your intrusion into the backrooms seems to have gone undetected.  The party is still in full swing, and from your vantage you can see several of Lush's other slaves, going about their duties in uniforms exactly the same as your own.  At the foot of the stairs the bouncer remains in place as well, arms crossed, looking just as imposing as when you had first met him.

Your moment's pause is justified by a fact you hadn't noticed before, however-- those servants who went upstairs always had one of the Club's silver trays, drink in hand.  And you don't have one.

[[You look around.->BRWardobe16]]


:: BRWardobe16
The most obvious source of a tray would be the bar, as you watch the bartender prepare a drink and hand it to Cherish.  Would the bartender recognize you, though?

Alternatively, you see another tray resting on a booth's table along the side wall.  The bartender is not near it, and neither are any of the other serving girls.  But the booth itself is occupied, by two men and two women who appear to be tourists.  

Or you could simply make for the stairs regardless.  Perhaps the Bouncer did not pay particular attention?

Taking a deep breath, you approach the bar, seeking a tray.  The bartender takes his time to reach you, focusing on the customers first, but does eventually step up before you.  His eyes fall upon your face for a moment, holding there... and then down to surface of the bar itself, which he polishes with a smile.

They do not notice as you move up alongside their table at all.

[[Uh oh...->ServStairs2]]


:: ServBarCheap
"Some real big spenders tonight, huh?" The Bartender replies with a wink, as he snaps the cap off a bottle.  To your relief he then produces one of the Club's silvered trays, placing the drink upon it before sliding it over.

He looks to you, expectantly.

[["Thank you."->ServBarEnd]]
[["Thank you, sir."->ServBarEnd]]

"It's not my first night on the job," the Bartender muses, with a smile.  "Forgetting the trays are standard?  I better not see you forgetting to show your panties when you deliver that drink, like a good girl."

His tone remains light as he slides the tray and drink your way.

[["I won't.  Thank you."->ServBarEnd]]
[["I won't.  Thank you, sir."->ServBarEnd]]

With a sigh of relief you take up the tray in the same manner you had observed the other girls utilizing, perching it atop your fingers and held just above shoulder height.

The bartender watches you go for a moment, until a customer calls him to the far side of the bar.

[[Whew.->PastBouncer]]


:: PastBouncer
Tray in hand, you make your back across the Club floor, to the staircase and its attendant guard.  Perhaps finding a tray *was* a good decision you muse, as the bouncer hardly pays you much attention-- and indeed ignores you altogether when a passing tourist inquires about the VIP area he was guarding.  Slipping by, you mount the stairs, undoubtedly providing anyone below with a clear upskirt view given the short length of your new uniform... but that couldn't be helped.  Setting the tray down upon the arm of a nearby recliner, you can at last exhale.  You made it.

[[The VIP area awaits.->VIPStart]]


:: ServTake
The tourists in the booth around the table seem embroiled in a conversation, some story regarding the spacecraft that had brought them to Torei, as you reach for the tray.  Just as your gloved hands fall upon it, however, one of the women points your way.

"Hey!  Not even going to ask if we need anything?"  She laughs, looking to the male at her side.  "Do it to her, Arnsel!"

Laughing in turn, Arnsel reaches for the control panel built into the booth-- pressing a button that immediately results in a sharp snap of pain running up from between your legs.  Apparently you were already synced to the Club's systems, although its a thought that emerges as a whimpered moan.

That draws amusement from all four of your tormentors.

[[Take the tray.->ServTake2]]
[["My apologies, Mistress, I'm just here for the tray."->ServAsk2]]


:: ServAsk
Having missed your approach entirely the four in the boot before you turn almost in unison, one of the women speaking up with a finger pointed your way.  "Oh, its the slave again!  Aren't you supposed to do the thing?  Lifting your skirt and showing your panties, I mean?"

She laughs, clearly drunk.

[[Do as she asked.->ServRev]]
[["Actually I'm just here to collect the tray."->ServAsk2]]
[[Simply take the tray.->ServTake2]]


:: ServRev
Despite their drunkenness, you attempt to provide them with the proper Torean experience-- perhaps the best means of avoiding suspicion.  Already drawn up beside the table you lift the front of your skirt and petticoat, revealing the smooth white laminate of your panties as you bow your head in greeting.

It goes over with much approval from the tourists, the loudest woman around them clapping her hands.  "Arnsel," she laughs, "do the thing!  We're supposed to reward them!"

Just what that meant is revealed by the male beside her reaching towards the booth's control panel, pressing a button.  The ring embedded in your clit sends a shiver of pleasure through you as a result, a wet moan slipping past your lips unexpectedly.  That just seems to please the group further.

"I told you, they're all whores like that," the other male announces.


[["Actually I'm just here to collect the tray."->ServAsk2]]
[[Simply take the tray.->ServTake2]]

Snatching the tray, you ignore the shouts of disapproval from the rancorous table you leave in your wake.  It's the loudest woman that can be heard announcing she would seek out 'your manager' as you disappear into the crowd.

The male nearest you, at the end of the booth, places his hand firmly upon the tray.  "This thing?"  He asks, looking to the others.  All three smile, watching intently as he turns back to you.  "I thought you slaves were supposed to *please* us, huh?  Lush is known for that.  So why don't you come here, sit on my lap?"

Swinging out one leg, he slaps his thigh.

[["Of course, Master."->ServAsk3]]
[["Give me the tray."->ServTakeT]]


:: ServAsk3
Attempting to keep your cover intact, you submit with a smile.  Like his three companions the male wears laminate, but of a loose style clearly intended to emulate offworld styles and design.  Your own utterly skintight uniform is quite something else, which he quickly ascertains by running a hand around your waist as you settle in.

"See, I don't bite," he laughs, even as his fingers run across your abdomen.  "Damn, do they paint this laminate stuff on you whores?"

"It's those Wardrobe thingers, like I said," the other male all but shouts, only to be mostly ignored by his friend.  It's hard to blame him, considering he has you on his lap.

"We should get you a skirt as short as this, Marion," he says, using his free hand to run through your petticoats.  

The woman to his side snorts loudly.  "No way in hell.  The slaves here, they may like being exposed like that but I sure wouldn't."

"No fun," the male replies, before using his hand to lift your chin, looking into your eyes.  He's surprisingly gentle.  "Is it true?  Do you *like* being dressed like this?"

"You got through to Petros?"  Even the idea seems to surprise the bouncer, his arms crossing before his chest as he smiles widely.  "Well hells, love, I can't imagine that was easy.  He has a reputation, you understand, especially with freewombs.  Just let me confirm that, alright?"

Flagging down one of the collared serving girls, he directs her towards the fully suited male-- still seated on the couch where you had engaged him.  Even from afar you can see the uniformed slave forced to demonstrate considerable submission before he deigns to notice her.  She does eventually get the confirmation however, returning to the bouncer with a nod.

"Well, go on through, love.  You've definitely earned it!  And enjoy... whatever it is that brought you to Club Lush's VIP section this evening."

"Me?  Nah.  Came here a few years ago, heard the work here could pay well.  And it does, for one of my gender.  Very well.  The planet is a strange place to me still, but hey, that's just how it is, right?"

*Strange indeed.*

:: VIPPay700
"Really?"  Despite his relatively laid back attitude, the man seems genuinely surprised.  "I hope you won't take offense if I confirm that?  Just show me your ID."

Handing it to him, he produces a small device from his back pocket.  Placing your ID upon it pulls your account information immediately, confirming you indeed have (print: $debt) credits in your account.

"Well, alright then," he concludes, pocketing the device again as he hands you back the ID.  "If this is really what you want, for 700 credits I'll get you confirmed for a day pass into our VIP area.  You'll have full access to the area upstairs, as well as the other standard amenities.  How does that sound?"

"Hey, don't be so down," the man replies, laying a heavy hand on your laminated shoulder.  "Honestly?  The day pass hardly justifies itself, unless you're here on a festival day or during one of our theme events.  Which you're not.  And if you're *really* intent on getting up there, maybe you can find another VIP member to grant you access?"

He pauses to wave at one of the collared serving girls walking past, a silver tray in her hand.  Then he looks back to you.  "Ain't no other way you get up there legitimately, love."

:: ServStairs2
You read confusion on his face, and yet... he doesn't move to intercede as you climb the stairs.  Doing so in your outfit with any dignity is entirely impossible, anyone even near the bottom provided with a clear view up your skirt, but you don't muster the courage to look back down until reaching the top.  There you see the bouncer, clearly staring at you.

[[Ignore him.  You've made it!"->VIPStart]]


:: ServAsk5 [Debt]
"Excuse me?"  The loud woman at the man's side had been watching with a growing frown, but she can't hold it in any longer.  Instead of directing her apparently quite capable ire at you, however, she levels it solely at the male molesting you.

"What *exactly* do you plan to with the whore, Arnsel?  Do I need to remind you who your girlfriend is?  We're not like *them*, with their open relationships and... and... fucking anything and everything!"

Somewhere within the rant Arnsel grips your waist, lifting you back up to a standing position so that he can turn to confrot his girlfriend more directly.  Thus begins a rousing argument, one you're fortunately saved from by the other man on the opposite end of the U-shaped booth.
(set: $debt to it + 50)
"I think we're good, take the tray, and here-- for the trouble."  He slides a 50 credit chit your way, a tip of sorts that seeks to compound by pointing towards the table's control console.  "Did you want another reward?  I wasn't sure if you *actually* like them, or..."

[["No, I'm alright."  Take the tray and leave them.->PastBouncer]]
[["I do, Master.  Please, do what pleases you to me."->ServAsk6]]
[["...yes, I want the reward..."->ServAsk6]]


:: ServAsk6
He shrugs and reaching out depresses one of the console's buttons.  Between your legs the ring embedded in your clit responds immediately, a shot of pleasure running from your womanhood, up your your core, to that soft, warm part of your brain that served as a pleasure center.  It felt so *good*, especially when it was some complete stranger whoe held such control over you.

That stranger in question watches you intently, ignoring the arguing couple.  "How was that?"

[["Wonderful, Master."->ServAsk7]]
[["Good.  Thank you."->ServAsk7]]


:: ServAsk7
"Good."  He slides the silver tray your way, even as he slaps you lightly upon the exposed flesh of your rear between stocking and skirt.  "Return to your duties, then."

[[Taking the tray, you head for the VIP area.->PastBouncer]]


:: VIP2
Your (if: $Sec is true)[bare](else:)[gloved] knuckles upon the door echo down the dark hall, the roaring party of the Club floor proper very much subdued this far back.  

No one answers.

[[Knock again.->VIP3]]
[["Hello...?"->VIP3]]


:: VIP3
You second attempt is met with much the same response.

Silence.

[[Knock MUCH harder.->VIP4]]
[["HELLO!?"->VIP4]]


:: VIP4
Just as you raise your nerve enough to attempt something more forceful, the door suddenly swings open-- revealing a bespectacled young man, looking a bit harried.

"Oh-- it's *you!*"  What had been frustration shifts upon his face, turning into a smile.  "I just *knew* you would make it.  No one turns it down.  And to think I thought you would be late!"

He seems to recognize the confusion that forms across your face (if: $Slave is true)[despite your breath regulating mask interceding], but misunderstands its source-- and diagnoses incivility.  "Where are my manners-- please, come in, come in.  There is no reason to conduct our business in the hallway of all places!"

[[Follow him inside.->VIP5]]


:: VIP5
Stepping inside the suite reveals it to be sumptuously decorate in dark hues, the most dramatic being laminate material hanging in ridges from a center point in the ceiling to places along the walls-- creating a massive faux-chandelier which reflects the light from sconces set into the walls.  

So too are you able to look over the man properly, his attire also laminate, a smart suitcoat and tailored trousers rendered in dark grey.  His tie is half undone however, a bit of dishevelment that's matched by the parlor you've entered into.  A sitting room can be seen through a doorframe to your left, and before you another door stands closed, but its within this small parlor itself it appears the man had been waiting for you.

Rubbing his hands together, he smiles widely.  "So-- you're here!"

The man pauses, perhaps for the first time recognizing signs of something more serious in your condition.  "Lucky to get this opprotunity!  Did something happen?  I *was* afraid you were going to back out.  That last time when we spoke, when I delivered the card... you seemed a little spooked."

Silently you stand in the center of the room, trying to understand what he meant.  Was he the contact?  Or had he just been a messenger?  What was going on here?

It's only then that you noticed the suitcase near the door you had entered through, it's entire front opened-- revealing a set of restraints, clearly position for someone to be folded up and locked inside.

"Why, that's how I brought it in here.  Just as it wanted."

[["What did you bring?"->VIPDae]]


:: VIPMeet
He looks to the suitcase that had caught your attention, then gives a disarming smile.

"Not really I suppose, but that's how I brought it in here.  Just as it wanted."

[["What did you bring?"->VIPDae]]


:: VIPDae
He blinks.  "The Emissary."

*Daemon*

"It's just through the door, with its offer.  Just as I promised when I delivered to you the Black Card, at that hotel you were staying at.  Just as I promised when I called you, to come back to Torei."

*His words send you reeling.  Your deal* **was** *with a Daemon, even if this man was serving as a middle-man of sorts.  Turning towards the door he had indicated, the closed one that presumably led to a bedroom, its almost like you can sense it.  A slice of divinity, if the AIs were Gods, puppeting a human body like a laminate marionette-- so very close now.  Waiting for you.  With an offer.*

You break from the reverie to find your hand upon the door, all but ready to push it open.

[[At least... hear it out.  If it could even speak.->VIPDae2]]


:: VIPDae2
<img src="img/rFMXUfL.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

The Daemon, the Emissary, waits for you in the center of the room.  (if: $Daemon is true)[You saw it before, in that alleyway back on the streets, and its much the same as you had glimpsed there.] Its body is uniformly covered in black laminate, stripping it of any individuality or sense of self.  There is no discernable face, only the glossy material remains, stretched so tightly across a male frame as evidenced by narrow hips and wide shoulders. Even so that masculinity is *intense*, as if the Daemon condensed it, adding potency as everything else was stripped away.  In that wake of simplified existance you feel your own curvaceous body all the more readily.  The swell of your breasts, the smooth run from hip to waist, your pert rear-- the other side of Daemon's equation.

It reaches out its hand.

[[Take it.->VIPDae3]]


:: VIPDae3
It has no words for you, and you realize then you wouldn't need any.  Its grip is firm, having seized your wrist instead of interlocking fingers as equals, drawing you further into the room-- away from the door back into the foyer, and closer to the bed.  Where something is laid out upon it.

A suit.  Black as a night without stars, yet so very reflective, promising to fill that void with sources of light all its own.  Smooth.  Glossy.  Featureless and all-consuming.  And yet... *familiar*.  Standing there before it, it takes you awhile, but you recognize it.  This... was no ordinary suit.  This was *your* isolation suit.  Careful measurement could have confirmed it, but your gut reaction is more then enough, akin to looking into a mirror.  A mirror just like that one you awoke to this morning in that hotel, a mirror you gaze into deeply, seeing not your own reflection but something... else.  A shadow of pleasure and ecstasy.

The male lifts the helmet, split into two portions yet lacking any hint of a seam.  Within you see the impression of a face-- your face.  And with it comes recollection.

[[You put it all together.->VIPDae4]]


:: VIPDae4
There were never material riches in this deal, and this isn't your first time on Torei.  As Corinth had suggested, you had come to this planet once, then twice, then again and again-- utterly enthralled by its possibilities.  But you had never indulged, Corinth and the hotel worker had made that clear as well.  An odd mixture of intrigue and restraint, perhaps that was what had drawn them to you.  The polar AIs, through their Daemon, with an offer you came to fear you would not-- could not-- refuse.  

Thus the Mem-Burn, the self-bondage.  A last desperate attempt to run out the clock, to force the missing of this rendezvous and drive you once more to the Way Up, this time without reason to return.  But you had underestimated even yourself, the will that had driven you to this point now all but handing you over to the Daemon.  To an offer of rapture and euphoria unending, all for the mere cost of your eternal liberty.  

This was the deal you stood to make.

[[The helmet is yours, you need only take it...->VIPDae5]]


:: VIPDae5
That damnable resolve that had driven you here does not break under the strain, however.  This deal is not yet done.  But the choice lies starkly before you, that helmet awaiting your presence.  

To take it would be to give yourself to the AI.  Inscrutable, unknowable, as harsh and alien as any being in this universe could be.  It would take your body, your liberty, your every waking moment.  But in return?  The potential for bliss unending, delivered by an immortal AI with untold millennia of experience in the arts of sensuality.  Free of conflict and worry, of responsibilities and dilemma.

To refuse it would be to set sail upon entirely unknown waters, knowledge of the depths scrubbed away by the Mem-Burn.  Perhaps there will reefs ahead an you will founder, to sink anyway.  Or maybe-- just maybe-- you could still make it to the Way Up.  Escape Torei.  Break from the grasp of artifical divinities and mortal Truant officers alike.

The choice is yours.

[[Take the helmet.->VIPTake]]
[[Refuse the helmet.->VIPRefuse]]


:: VIPTake
<img src="img/RgEruqK.png" width="30%" height="30%">

You accept.  Gods help you, you take the helmet into your hands.  (if: $Slave is true)[From behind you feel the Daemon removing your breath regulating mask, then slowly peeling away your hood-- giving you a brief taste of freedom even as you lift the helmet.]  Slowly, ever so slowly, you bring it up towards your waiting face.  How could it this easy, to give up everything?  But it is.  Damn it all, it's as easy as pressing the helmet to your face.  Closer and closer, until finally-- with glorious finality, you feel the impossibly soft laminate of the AI's construction for the very first time.  It envelopes your lips, your nose, your chin-- then your entire head in its cool embrace.  You're blinded, gagged, deaf, helpless, even as you feel the Daemon moving the back portion into place to complete the seal.

Afterward he presses against you, masculinity and femininity joining in rapturous union that takes the form of a simple embrace.  Even this first experience feels so strange, so wonderful, so terrifying-- and its only just begun.

You're *Lost in Laminate*, and couldn't be happier.

[[Twelve Hours Later.->VIPTake2]]


:: VIPRefuse
Your hands tremble, the word necessary dying upon your tongue.  Rationality and subconscious desires run up against each other, stalling  you.

You must try harder-- or give in entirely.

[[Take the helmet.->VIPTake]]
[[Refuse the helmet.->VIPRefuse2]]


:: VIPRefuse2
That insidious curiosity that has defined you had brought you to this planet, again and again.  To look upon its wonders and yet be held apart by an ironclad sense of dignity and restraint.  These past few hours since waking, the only ones you can fully remember, had seen to the demolition of that restraint.  Now more primal intrigues run rampant, calling for the helmet, for senseless acceptace of eternal servitude.

Once more.

[[Take the helmet.->VIPTake]]
[[Refuse the helmet.  "No."->VIPRefuse3]]


:: VIPRefuse3
**"No."**

The words break the spell, your own reflection catching in the glossy play of light along the mask.  You step back, even as the Daemon remains, still holding the helmet.

[[Run.->VIPRun]]


:: VIPRun
To persist any longer in its presence would break you, in spite of yourself.  Spinning on your heels, you flee.  Bursting through the door back into the foyer, you startle the man waiting there from his seat, his confusion evident even as you push by in a flurry of snapping heels and glossy laminate.

You leave the suite in as much of a sprint as you can handle, (if: $Ballet is true)[nearly tripping in your ballet heels,] you make for the lights and sounds of Club Lush.  Every pounding beat from the music helps to push the allure of the Daemon from your mind, and with a deep sigh of relief you emerge onto the balcony-- coming up against the railing.

And it's from there that you can see Truant Officers moving through the crowd.

[[What is going on!?->VIPTruant]]


:: VIPTruant
From your vantage, you can clearly see two main groups of Officers, one covering the Club's front exit and the other the rear.  The party is still in full swing, Cherish had mentioned such sweeps weren't uncommon, but they do appear to be coordinating so as to check in at every table and with every patron.

(if: $BRVIP is true)[Far more distressingly, you notice Akrai's dark red catsuit with black accessories near the front-- she's pinned against the wall by two officers, while a third is directing several more both towards the backroom entrance and towards the VIP stairs.  The damnable woman must have been trying to escape, only to have been caught in the sweep-- and if she mentioned your presence in the backrooms, having freed her?  At the very least they had to be suspecting someone.](else-if: $BarSaw is true)[Far more distressingly, you notice the bartender talking with several officers near the front door.  He's pointing to another of the serving girls, and then in turn towards the VIP stairs.  The implication is clear: he *had* recognized you, somehow.](else-if: $TourAng is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see the tourists you interacted with earlier near the front of the Club, speaking with the bartender and several Officers.  It appears your earlier storming away from them had led to their promised seeking of a manager, who undoubtedly realized you were not of the Club's usual workforce.](else-if: $Bouncered is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see the VIP section's bouncer near the front of the door, speaking with several of the Officers.  If you had been concerned he had recognized your deception upon passing without a tray, that appears to confirm it.](else-if: $SargonNo is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see Tysus Sargon speaking with several Officers near the front doors.  She's gesturing aggressively with her hands, then towards the stairs leading up to the balcony upon which you stand.  She *had* expressed a desire to see you punished for refusing to tell her about your deal, and it very much looks like she's making good on the threat now.](else-if: $SargonBother is true)[Far more distressingly, you can see Tysus Sargon speaking with several Officers near the front doors.  She's gesturing aggressively with her hands, then towards the stairs leading up to the balcony upon which you stand.  She *had* expressed a desire to see you punished after bothering her too far about being taken up into the VIP area, and it very much looks like she's making good on the threat now.](else-if: $PetrosTry is true and $PetrosFail is true)[Far more distressingly, you notice Petros standing near the front with several other Officers.  You're familiar enough with his body language that even masked as he is you can make out anger, apparently being directed towards the VIP section's stairs behind you.  He *had* spoken of a desire to see you punished after failing to please him, and it appears he's now making good on that threat.](else:)[Miraculously you believe you've avoided making any enemies during your time at Lush, or at the very least you don't see any particular attention being directed towards the balcony you stand upon, but you could never really feel safe with Truant Officers around.]

(if: $debt is < 0)[There is the matter of your account balance to consider as well, your efforts having run you down into negative territory.  If they're checking for debtors, and its reasonable to assume they would, you have a major problem on your hands.](if: $Servant is true)[ And of course, it simply would *not* end well if they found you wearing the collar and uniform of a Lush slave.  Even ignoring the possibility of the contract you signed actually being enforced, they could also charge you for false impersonation-- or probably a myriad of other, far more Torean crimes.](if: $Slave is true)[And of course, you just *know* they are unlikely to treat a freewomb in a slave-coded uniform very well.  That's just to be expected.]

If those Officers detain you, there will be no way for you to make it back to the the Way up.  You cannot risk it.

(if: $CherishT is > 0)[[[A hand falls upon your shoulder.->VIPCherish]]](else:)[[[Plan your move.->VIPTruant2]]]


:: VIPTruant2 [Variables]
From your vantage upon the balcony, you at least have the perfect position from which to plan your next move.  A quick count reveals about a dozen officers, four near the front door, six at the rear, two moving through the Club itself.  That made sense-- as you had seen on your way in, most of the traffic the Club saw used the rear entrance, while the front was reserved for men or those freewombs willing to pay a premium.
(set: $EscapePath to 0)(set: $TruantCount to 0)(set: $Wanted to 0)
Unfortunately it becomes quite clear that your options are limited, and your quickly running out of time.  Deciding on focusing on the front door is easy enough, given the fewer Officers.  But what then?  The most straightforward approach would be to simply approach them, although that would be akin to giving yourself up if they had any particular reason to arrest you.  Still-- anything else would be suspicious at the very least.

Alternatively, you could try to blend in with the crowds, then make a run for it if they noticed you.  (if: $CherishPlan is true)[With Cherish's promised assistance, perhaps you could even pull it off(if: $Servant is true)[-- although given your new uniform, and the fact none of the other similarly dressed slaves are near the door?  Perhaps not].](else:)[The chances of success seem quite low, however.  It looks like they're checking everyone leaving or entering(if: $Servant is true)[, and certainly none of the other slaves dressed like you are being let through].]

The only other option would be something far more... dramatic.  Turning to your left, you can see a small panel built into the wall, painted red.  FIRE ALARM is stenciled atop it.  Pulling that would incite chaos, making it almost trivial to slip out... but that would be blatantly illegal, the consequences unknown.

They have you now.
(set: $DaemonEnd to true)(set: $Status to 4)
Your Isolation Laminate is as perfect as you had been lead to believe.  Moreso even.  The experience of wearing it, in its entirety, is beyond description.  And that was *before* the pleasure cycles had started.  You lost count of your orgasms somewhere in the twenties, and that had been hours ago when it had directed you to the bed.  Now you're utterly lost to the rapture, to its pleasure.  Sometimes the male joins you, but other times he's absent from the room.  You're not sure why.  It's not your concern.  It never should have been.

Is the absence of ecstasy a feeling?  Already you cannot imagine it, but look upon it like a nightmare, horrific and unreal.  Only the shame remains, and that grows dimmer with each sensation that emanates from your tortured, rapturous cunt.  The thought of your womanhood sends your hands downward, playing across your encapsulated breasts, down along your strictly corseted waist, to the meeting of your thighs.  You cannot enter yourself, *They* have already claimed you, but the suit rewards your promiscuity nevertheless.  Pleasure atop pleasure.  Writhing, moaning, you cum again.

[[And again... and again...->VIPTake3]]


:: VIPTake3
Understanding had come to you slowly, but They had made it clear.  That lingering shame you wrestled with, at having given yourself to this fate, it could be so easily done away with.  If you admitted to *yourself* you could not control what was happening to you, there would be no guilt.  Just pleasure.  Always pleasure.  You cum again, arching your back, feeling the suit sucking on your nipples, draining some liquid down your throat.  The details didn't matter, not when you could be cumming again.

But instead They ask you to rise, and you do.  Why wouldn't you?  The male awaits, perhaps he had been beside the bed this entire time.  He presses his hand against your sealed cunt, claiming it.  But it was not him, it was Them.  Just as your hand against his bulge is not your own, its their will-- you just obey.  Together you submit, as you always will.  

You emerge out into daylight, the warmth of it upon your obsidian skin so very wonderful.  Where are you?  It doesn't matter.  What are you doing?  It doesn't matter.  

The crowds along the sidewalks part as you pass, their whispered words allowed to reach your ears.

She was taking to her Isolation Laminate well, just as you had imagined.  An offworlder, well traveled and curious, a story similar to your own.  Perhaps that was why you had been directed to offer the Black Card, to meet with her in this dimly lit warehouse.  To make an offer, a deal, one she had accepted.  And thus They would have another to question, to examine, to learn more of the galaxy you and she had traveled so extensively.

But motives hardly matter.  Instead you're directed to submit, and of course you do.  You would further her pleasure, quicken the transition. Thus they command. Kneeling atop the bags that served as her bed, your black laminate bodies press together and she rouses, eagerly embracing you. 

Soon you're cumming in unison with the other Daemon.

Faced with impending crisis, you act boldly indeed.  The Ministry of Truants held power over Freewombs and slaves alike because of their institutional order, throwing that into momentary chaos thus gave you the best chance to escape.

Pandemonium breaks out immediately as alarms cut through and then silence the pounding music, followed shortly thereafter by the spray of water that comes from sprinklers hidden in the ceiling.  As you move to go down the VIP stairs that had taken you so much effort to ascend you can see panic spreading as the crowds below begin rushing the exits.  The line of Truant Officers guarding the front door collapses in the onslaught of bodies, which you soon join.

She flicks the hem of your skirt.  "I hope whatever your motive was, it was worth it.  Because Master Kaleb, who owns Lush, owns that collar and you as well now.  And I would think it likely he will ask for your release to him.  You're a Torean slave now."

"So what are we going to do with her?"  The question comes from the second officer who is still holding you firmly.

Nikaido considers for a moment, then pushes the brim of her cap back a bit.  "That depends on our Truant, I supposed.  Does she admit to the charges brought against her?  (if: $Servant is true)[You're already enslaved, but I would imagine you would be kept in one of our punishment sarcophagi for a few weeks as the details are worked out."](else:)[Given the charges you're looking at a considerable length of time spent in one of our punishment sarcophagi, until a Court can hear your case.

She nods, as if only then finding her own conclusion acceptable.  "Put her with the others, in a detention cage for the time being.  This entire situation is going to be a hell of a lot of paperwork."

[[Allow yourself to be pulled along.->VIPArrest5]]


:: VIPArrest5Fight
With you arms already cuffed behind you, and the Truant Officer without any such restrictions, its not exactly a fair fight as she rounds on you, shock baton in hand.  Their Ministry's favorite weapon is deployed with blunt determination, being slid quickly between your legs before the switch is flicked.  The electrical discharge is *intense*, your laminate offering absolutely zero protection as you're given a good long taste.

Afterward, gasping a bit from the experience, the Officer drags you far more easily towards your fate.

[[Ouch...->VIPArrest5]]


:: VIPArrest5
Just what 'being put with the others' meant is revealed soon after, as the Officer leads you towards a machine somewhere between a proper flatbedded vehicle and a smaller transport device.  Marked with the Ministry of Truant's livery, its a sensible enough choice for a police force operating within Grand Aekora's strange covered walkways.  A crowd is formed around it already, the reason why becoming clear as the Officer pushes through.

The back of the vehicle is a flatbed, atop which are stacked a number of steel cages.  Featuring bars on all four sides, with what appears to be a top portion that could be unlocked to provide access, they're quite small-- and already some are occupied.  The prisoners are dressed in varying manners, undoubtedly because they were picked up somewhere else tonight by the Officers sweeping the Clubs, but their situation is universal.  Each is locked into an individual cage, laying on her back with legs folded but spread.  Some are gagged and most are moaning, but the sound of vibrators at work is universal.  Each cage also has a pair of handcuffs clipped just outside, and it appears many of the unfortunates have their wrists restrained by them, the bars far enough apart to allow hands to pass through at least.

[[Torean justice at its finest.->VIPArrest6]]


:: VIPArrest6
The sounds of the prisoner's distress only grows louder as you approach, thus presumably accounting for the crowd, many of them looking like tourists.  Leading you to an empty cage, the Officer swings the top panel open.

"This one is all yours, (if: $Servant or $Slave is true)[slave](else:)[whore.]"  She unfastens your cuffs, although maintains a firm grip on your shoulder in the event you suddenly grew skittish.  "Up and in you go now, just like the others.  Works best if you lay back first, then fold in your legs.  You *will* keep them spread."

[["Yes, Officer."->VIPArrest7]]
[["Fine, fine..."->VIPArrest7No]]


:: VIPArrest7
Without anywhere to run, you can only carefully step up onto the vehicle's flatbed, (if: $Ballet is true)[your ballet heels making it a precarious effort indeed,  ]before turning around and momentarily taking a seat on the lip of the cage.  From there you lean back carefully, settling back down into a cage just barely wide enough to hold you-- and certainly not long enough.  As you had observed of the others, and as the Officer had commanded, you're thus forced to fold your legs and spread them, allowing you just enough clearance to be below the lip.

To your left a woman in red and black laminate watches you with forlorn eyes, her red laminate catsuit ornamented with black accessories.  (if: $BRVIP is true)[You recognize her as Akrai, what must have been a failed escape attempt having now caught you up as well.  With a laminate panel across her lips and presumably a gag beneath that she cannot speak, but its easy enough to read melancholy on her expression.]  She moans lewdly, the hum of powerful vibrators terribly audible.  At least the cage to your other side is unoccupied.

Hooked to the portion of the cage nearest your head are a set of handcuffs, and while your hands would have to be slipped outside the cage to use them the Officer notices your attention and intervenes.

"Those are only if you *want* them," she grins.  What could that mean?  She doesn't explain, but instead climbs up onto the flatbed.  (if: $Slave is true)["I'm going to take your mask off, then I want your mouth open.  Is that understood?"](else:)["Mouth open."]

[["Yes, Officer..."->VIPArrest8]]


:: VIPArrest7No
Reaching up, the Officer grabs one of your nipples, tweaking it hard.  Simple, yet quite effective in getting your attention.

(if: $Pierced is true)["Pierced, huh?  Of course you are."]  She narrows her eyes.  "Don't take that tone with me.  You will use my title, or you will regret it.  Is that clear?"

[["...yes, Officer.->VIPArrest7]]


:: VIPArrest8
(if: $Slave is true)[Undoing your mask's locks with the overrides all Truant Officers must possess, you're soom freed of the infernal breath regulator, returning you to a (slightly) more natural state of only the laminate hood that covers everything excepting your eyes and mouth.  Carefully the Officer places your mask beside you, in the cage.]  Reaching to her belt, the Officer then produces something you're unfortunately familiar with-- a ball gag, along with a full head harness.  With your mouth held open as requested its easy for her to slide the shiny orange ball between your lips, seating it firmly behind your teeth as she works to secure the straps.  One by one they're tightened until she's satisfied, finishing the installation with a pair of small padlocks, one on the buckle behind each ear.

With that accomplished she jumps down from the flatbed only to then reach to your cage door, swinging it back into place, and locking it with a third padlock-- this one quite heavy.  

Settling into the small confines of your cage, adjusting to the sensation of your ballgag between your teeth, the Officer however intervenes-- she's not done yet.  "You will keep your legs spread."

:: VIPArrest9
(if: $Plugs is true)[Sliding a of *glass* device from her hip, the Officer consults it for a moment even as her hand slides between the bars and up between your legs, landing upon the base of the plugs sealed within there.  "As I thought," she muses.  "Whore like you already has plugs?  Good.  Well I'm syncing to them now."](else-if: $Servant is true)[Reaching between the bars, and thus between your legs, the position on your back provides easy access to the white panties of your uniform.  Unceremoniously she pushes them aside, revealing your cunt and asshole.

"I am going to be installing a set of plugs within you," she warns, pulling back for a moment to retrieve a pair of truly horrid looking dildos.  Rendered in bright orange laminate, their thick shafts appear to be accuarely modeled, the faux veins becoming even more visible as she pours a bit of lube upon them.

No other warning is given before she drives them into place, starting with the vaginal one before progressing to the rear.  In short order you feel utterly filled, the walls of your cunt in particular quaking from the new intruders.

"I'm syncing with them now," the Officer narrates nonchalantly, holding a *glass* device in hand.  "And... ah, I see you have a clit piercing.  Let's access that too."](else:)[Reaching between the bars, and thus between your legs, the position on your back provides easy access to the (if: $Sec is true)[area within your pencil skirt.](else:)[zippers of your catsuit, which is opens.]

"There we go," the Officer announces, apparently achieving just what she had sought to do.

"Now here is the trick-- while detained you're under orgasm restrictions.  If you cum, that would be another mark on record.  And you really don't need more of that right now.  But your plugs are *not* going to be set with a denial mode.  Keeping yourself from climax is going to be up to you, truant."  She flicks the cuffs hanging from the end of the cage.  "Feel free to use those if you need them, although do be aware most judges consider their use to be admissible in court as proof of low impulse control."

Looking around you recognize most of the other detainees have restrained themselves in that manner.  The Officer meanwhile only grins, holding up her *glass* so you can watch as her finger descends.  

"Have fun."

...and then thrum to life.  Front and rear, the thick laminate rods slotted so easily between your legs dance with a fury that catches you by surprise-- even knowing what was coming.  The sensations are as deeply pleasurable as they are maddening, the muscles of your womanhood pulling tight against them without any real control your part.  Nor can you prevent the way your legs seek to straighten, you thighs trying to move further apart.  The cage itself intercedes there however, keeping you neatly constrained.  (if: $Plugs is true)[Having grown somewhat accustomed to being plugged, its still difficult to endure.]

It's not long before the first moan slips around the ball forced between your lips, joining the lewd chorus of other similarly tortured slaves and freewombs.  The small crowd around the police sledge remain as well, your violation being little more then amusing theater to them.

Locking yourself into them would prevent your hands betraying you at the very least, and that would certainly keep your orgasms at bay-- for awhile.

Sliding one wrist into the opening maw of the cuffs requires positioning them outside the bars, the chain between each cuff in turn ensuring you could not pull them back in once secured.  Featuring auto-locks actually snapping them into place is simple enough, and in short order you're sealed in.  Testing the results you try to pull your hands back into the cage, only for the chain to prevent that- as expected.

Almost in unison you cry out, earning a round of laughter from the Officers near the front.

"I swear they don't fix that bump just to teast Truants," one of them notes.

(set: $Strikefix to true)Passing through opened doors, the sledge, its Officer drivers, and the truants locked into the cages in the back all pass from the covered walkways of downtown Grand Aekora into the night.  The crowds diminish immediately, curfew undoubtedly playing a major part in that equation.  Looking up through the barred top of your cage, you're greeted to a view of the Andromeda galaxy spread before you-- millions of stars, thousands of worlds... and you're down here, wrapped in glossy laminate, locked inside a cage.  Just *where* you are going isn't clear, but you can hear Officer Nikaido discussing it with one of her subordinates.

"Another team picked up the runner's scent," she can be heard explaining.  "We will park for a little while, see if we can smoke her out.  We're *just* at quota now, so I'd love an extra one for that empty cage.  Then we can play with that Offworlder."

(set: $Strikefix to true)Emerging from the darkness, a pair of officers haul a familiar woman towards the waiting sledge and its cages-- the one who touched you back at the Club.  Putting two-and-two together, you conclude this must have been the "runner" they mentioned having been spotted in the area.

Whatever the case, she's not given a chance to explain herself-- despite rather frantic attempts.  Instead of hearing her out however, Nikaido directs her fellow Officers to prep her for a cage.  Gag, plugs, being forced into the small barred box directly beside you-- its a familiar fate, one you cannot help but feel sympathy for.  She looked like a tourist, did she really have an idea of the fate she had just been subjected to?

You certainly do by now, a thought that fires your arousal despite it all.

(set: $Strikefix to true)For the second time the Officers appear to be preparing to leave, and again Nikaido appears amongst the cages-- although this time she stands boldy before them all, speaking to you all.

"Listen here, truants!  Seeing as we've only collected a few recidivists tonight, I imagine you're wondering what is going to happen to you?  Well-- sometime tomorrow you will moved to the Ministry of Truant's holding pens, in preparation for your trial.  Before we get to *that* however, here in Aekora we like to demonstrate just what happens to whores like yourselves who break our laws!  So-- we're headed to a public corrective installation, where you will serve as a lesson to your fellow freewombs or slaves, for a length of time accordant with your alleged crimes.  And believe me, by the time your service is up you will be begging for prison-- which will be just fine, because this experience does not count as time served, but is merely considered a public service, given the time you have demanded of us Ministry Officers!  Is that understood?"

Looking through the cages with a wicked grin on her lips, Nikaido holds up her *glass* device.  "I said: *is that understood?*"
(set: $PP to it + 1)
Pressing the button ignites a particularly strong reaction from your plugs, a reaction apparently shared by the others as they squirm and moan.  You add to that myriad collection of tortured cries, (if: $Servant is true)[the sensation furthered by your clit piercing, (set: $PP to it + 1)](if: $Slave is true)[the sensation furthered by your slave suit, (set: $PP to it + 1)]a response that seems to please the Officer.

(set: $Strikefix to true)For a moment you must think you're dreaming, or hallucinating in a fugue state of tortured pleasure-- as before you rises a large building, the glowing neon sign identifying it as "Direct Shuttle to the Way Up."  Salvation!  So close-- and yet so very far.  While the sledge does stop you're still quite trapped, and Nikaido's words still ring in your head.  *Public corrective installation.*  A very Torean sounding fate, and one that would perhaps make sense so near the escape route of the Space Elevator.  Where better to make such a display?
(set: $PP to it + 1)
For now however the Officers attending you and your fellow truants merely begin to disembark, one of them going to a vending machine near the building's doors.  Another actually enters, propping the door open to reveal the bright light and activity within-- despite curfew, it seems to be a bustling travel hub.

[[You, meanwhile, languish in your cage.->ArrestRoll]]


:: Event8
(set: $Strikefix to true)With the snap of heeled boots upon pavement, the Truant Officers come for the first cage-- on the side furthest from you.  It takes all four of them to lift it down, the truant within pressing against the bars, as they haul her inside.  Just what happens then is lost to you, your cage not providing a view of the building's interior, but you cannot imagine it is good.
(set: $PP to it + 1)

:: Event9
(set: $Strikefix to true)The Officers are taking their time, but they're making steady progress through the truants they collected.  Cages go in, and they do not come back out.  

It's a fate eventually shared by the cages to your left and right.  (if: $BRVIP is true)[Akrai](else:)[The woman in red] is first, her eyes meeting yours as they slide her cage away-- she had made use of the cuffs, restraining herself, but a bit of fire still burns in her eyes.

(if: $Servant is true)[The collar around your neck and the clit piercing between your legs only furthers that thought.  It may still be a technicality, but you *do* have an owner right now.

:: Event11
The waiting proves to be the worst, but eventually the Officers do come for you-- all four, led by Nikaido.  Seizing your cage, they carry you towards the opened door of the brightly lit building.  You press up against the bars, if only to sate your curiosity, the difference between natural night and artifical day within requiring a few moments for your eyes to adjust...

[[You blink rapidly.->ArrestEnd]]


:: Event1Resist
Positioned on your back, legs folded and pressed up against the bars of your cage, resistance is not exactly possible.  You do try to bring your knees together, mewling into your gag, but the inquisitive girl hardly seems to notice.

Anything further is broken up by the sharp snap of heels upon the pavement, heralding the rapid approach of a Truant Officer.  The girl smiles towards you then backs off, sliding back into the crowd even as the Officer tries to follow.

Sometime later the Officer returns, apparently empty-handed.  Had she escaped?  Either way, your efforts to defend yourself have limited the arousal she induced in you.

Shuttles load up on the far end of the large building, but your eyes are drawn far more immediately to the rows of bound women lining each side of the entrance walkway.  Each are cloaked in uniform black laminate, from bondage hood covered head to stiletto heeled toe, their bodies harnessed to cruel looking restraint frames.  Armbinders draw their limbs backward while a chain ran from collar to floor force their head down, requiring of them a torturous strappado position that must be agony to hold for any true length of time.  Many are moaning or screaming loudly, but ther heavy duty gags prevent all but muffled mewls-- and above it all you hear the continued insidious roar of their plugs.  Clearly those had not bee removed.

You pass them by, each in turn, until coming to a final frame-- unoccupied, but pregnant with expectation.  There your plugs are finally calmed, at least for the moment, and Nikaido opens up your cage.  Reaching in, she undoes your gag(if: $Cuffed is true)[ but makes no effort to remove the cuffs you subjected yourself to].

That you're in good company hardly helps with the prospect of such treatment, torture, and enslavement so clearly on the horizon however, the shock on your face clearly evident as the Officer clears her throat.

"But I have an offer to make of you..."

"Temporary parole.  We pulled in enough truants tonight to hit our quota, thus I'm giving you the chance to *earn* a reprieve from at least some of what is coming to you."

"Find something of interest to us in the few hours we give you, and depending on how good it is I will put in to have your infraction count reduced, and thus your eventual sentence.  And if you do *very* well?  Perhaps we could make use of you further.  The Ministry of Truants largely conscripts our Officers from the inmate population, and while the training and life are not easy... I can personally attest to how quickly your freedom can be earned, if you do the work well."

*There is, of course, a third possibility.  Complete and total escape from Torei.  You're not sure how, but given a few borrowed hours of freedom perhaps you could still save yourself... you're already so close to the Way Up, after all.*

"So, what will it be?"  Officer Nikaido asks, crossing her arms beneath her chest.  "Stay under arrest and go onto the punishment frame, or a few hours parole?"

"Good choice," Officer Nikaido replies, clasping her hands together.  "As I said-- I don't care where you go, or what you do, just bring me some actionable information and I will see your sentence reduced.  Demonstrate you can do more then that, bring me a truant for example, and I'll even offer you conscription into the Ministry.  You'll have until the end of my shift-- midnight."

That doesn't give you much time, but you hardly expect pity from the Officer at this point.  Stepping forward she does offer a hand to help you from the cage however, although when you go to take it she seizes your wrist instead.

"There is one more thing, before you go.  Know that if you fail me, or if you try to take this opportunity to run, I *will* find you.  And to make sure you don't get into any trouble..."

"Stupid girl," the Officer spits, before gesturing sharply over her own shoulder as she steps away.  "Rig her up with the others then, if she wants it so badly."

And they do.  Cutting away your previous garments, they replace them with stark black laminate, an exact match for the tortured rows of other women all around you.  Catsuit and corset, heels and gloves, cuffs and armbinder.  They're added to your body one by one, stripping you of freedoms as simple as the right to use your own hands-- until the final piece is held before you.  The mask.  Rendered in heavy, thick laminate, you cannot help but think of a similar mask, offered so recently by the Daemon.  But this one you cannot turn down.

Once masked, the only thing left is to rig you to the punishment frame.  Without eyes to see or a mouth to scream, you're forced into a strict position bent over, your restrained arms held up and above you in a strappado position that quickly proves uncomfortable.  There you are rigged, locked to the frame, but not yet done-- the final instrument of your punishment comes in the form of your dildos, still installed, roaring to life.

"How long for this one?" You can just barely hear the Officer nearest you ask of Nikaido.  The response is immediate.

It happens so quickly-- a quick click, the needle moves, and when she steps back?  A ring of metal remains, ran through your septum.  The pain comes soon after, blunted somewhat by a coating upon the ring presumably intended to quicken healing.

"If you do not come back here by midnight, we will use that to come find you.  Do *not* make me do that.  And of course it will trigger any security checkpoints you attempt to pass through, so don't wander *too* far.  Parolees who are detained again rarely enjoy the consequences."

She makes no mention of removing the plugs you had been tortured with, and you're unwilling to push the subject further.

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you've been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant's uniform.

In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.

Eventually you arrival at a terminal building that promises free shuttles to the Way Up, operating on constant schedule-- this near the beating heart of Torean commerce, such things never slept.  And yet, stepping through the vestibule, its here you get a taste of what failure may have meant for you.

Truants line the walkway before you, each wearing laminate outfits of obvious severity, the punishment frames they're secured to forcing them into a deeply uncomfortable position.  Without eyes to see, due to their blindfolds, nor mouths to screan-- due to their gags-- they are left to merely endure.  Signs above each meanwhile explain why they were being subjected to such treatment.  Some are common enough crimes, theft for instance, but most seem to have fallen afoul of Torean culture: curfew violations, debtors and the like.

Passing by them as quickly as possible, if only to escape their muffled moans-- of ecstasy or agony you cannot rightly tell apart-- you board one of shuttles making for the way up.

The attendant smiles.  "The details vary considerably, but given your previous lack of interest in Torean culture... we would make efforts to ensure that you get to experience the joys of your gender."

Her wording is vague, and it doesn't improve.  "If your debts are high enough, we would also ensure that *others* would enjoy your experience, so to speak.  But we can discuss that further, after we address any other questions you might have-- and just how extensive your debt it."

Like a strand of gleaming pearls suspended in the night, the Space Elevator soon stretches before you, disappearing up into the clouds.  On approach via the shuttle, you pass beyond Aekora's strict borders-- although your fractured memories allow you to piece back together that this wasn't unusual.  Many of the Ringdoms near the elevator but not directly abutting it had treaties to allow direct lines like the one you're riding to the elevator base itself.

That would mean passing through an Aekoran customs checkpoint, the last before entering into the legally distinct area maintained by the Space Elevator authority-- where Torean contracts and slavery no longer applied.  (if: $Wanted is 0)[Having emerged from Club Lush without Truant Officers seeking to detain you, however, you suspect you will recieve little hassle-- at least on that particular front.](if: $Wanted is 1)[Having emerged from Club Lush with Truant Officers seeking to detain you, however, you have to imagine getting through will not be easy-- and being captured would be a horrific fate indeed.](if: $Wanted is 2)[Having emerged from the Truant Officer's grasp as a registered Truant on parole, however, you have to imagine getting through would be all but impossible-- and being caught in an attempt would induce a fate you cannot even imagine.]  (if: $Slave is true)[Your standardized slave suit presents another potential problem, as the application of certain slave codes while wearing it would undoubtedly lead to your arrest if you attempted to simply walk through.  You would need to find a way out of the locked gear.](if: $Servant is true)[The collar you wear alongside your serving girl uniform presents another potential problem, as one in your situation would certainly be arrested if approaching customs directly.  You would need to find a way out of your locked gear, and a way to clear your status as a slave.]

Still-- as the shuttle pulls into port, you need only look up through the glass ceiling above to see your way off Torei so very close.  Can you make it off planet?

*Do you still want to?*

[[You step from the shuttle.->CustomsArrive2]]


:: CustomsArrive2
The final customs checkpoint looms ahead of you, words painted above the series of exits making that point clear: EXITING SOVEREIGN TOREAN TERRITORY.  Between the long lines there, and your position on the far end of the Aekoran conclave, several other things jump out to you however.

The first is a rather large gathering near the checkpoint, a woman standing atop a decorative planter allowing her to use the voice-amplifier she's speaking through all the more effectively.  Distance prevents you from hearing everything, but you do recognize a familiar phrase-- *Liberty Society.*  Advocates for women and the enslaved, as well as less distinctly legal ventures.  

It takes a moment, but you finally realize why the crowd seemed so strange to you-- after a full day surrounded by a sea of laminate, this close to the space elevator tourists and offworlders seemingly outnumber the native-born Toreans, making offworld textiles more common.  Instead of blending in, your (if: $Blue is true)[slick blue catsuit](if: $Smoke is true)[slick transparent catsuit](if: $Brand is true)[slick branded catsuit](if: $Sec is true)[slick secretarial laminate](if: $Slave is true)[fully enclosed catsuit](if: $Servant is true)[glossy servant's attire] now sticks out rather immediately.  In fact, already a few of those passing by stare at you.

Addressing that could be achieved at the banks of Wardrobe machines you see along the side wall, although obviously that would take a few credits.  Still-- to your amazement, you actually see a woman emerge from one wearing a very plain, quite ugly shift-- but it is *not* laminate!

Before you get any further in your slow examination of the customs enclave, however, a hand lands upon your shoulder.

:: CuAns
You explain your encounter in the VIP section of Club Lush.  The Daemon, the mere thought of which still haunts your thoughts.  Its offer, as infernal as it may have been tempting.  A lifetime of pleasure unending, all for the mere price of your total and utter submission.  What would it have felt like, to slide into that isolation laminate?

You will likely never know, although you suspect shaking such thoughts may be difficult.

Corinth, for her part, actually seems quite intrigued-- even if your conclusion, of any hope of a deal having fallen through, does dampen her spirits somewhat.

"Well... I guess there is nothing really holding you here, to Torei, then?  I've been here awhile obviously, waiting for you.  There is something you should see, they have these automated kiosks to determine your customs status.  Probably good to know.(if: $Slave is true and $CorSlave is true)[  We will... both need to use the slave version, though.]"

She takes a deep breath, or as deep as she could manage give her corset and mask.  "I had heard what this place was like, of course... Torei.  The laminate, the slavery... but to actually experience it, as you've... *forced* me to do..."

(if: $Slave is true)[You notice immediately a twitching in her gloved fingers, the way her hand seems to drift towards the meeting of her thighs.  It's a feel you know all too well, birthed by a desire your shared plugs induced so easily.

"How have you... managed to stand it, wearing... all this?"](else:)[You notice one of her gloved hands twitching a bit, pulling towards the space between her legs.  "It's been so hard, the... sensations, the way others... look at me.  It feels so... so..."]

Reaching down, you lift the front hem of your skirt, revealing your gleaming white panties underneath.  Torean decorum dictated the way you bow your head to her, completing the curtsy.  When your eyes finally lift again you find Corinth staring at you, a bit aghast.

[["It's expected of me, Corinth.  As a slave."->CuServ3]]
[["I got into... a bit of trouble at the Club."->CuServ2]]


:: CuServ2
You explain your arrival at the Club, and your need to reach the VIP area balcony.  That had led you to surreptitiously exploring the backrooms, and eventually your coming upon that wardrobe machine.  From it you had emerged a different being altogether, both in dress, and how Toreans saw you.  A collared slave.

Corinth listens intently, her eyes wide, a hand even coming to her chest out of concern for your predicament.  When you finish she sighs, reaching up to her own throat, as if to imagine a collar there.

"Well... this makes your getting offworld so much harder.(if: $CorSlave is true)[  And... well, can we talk about *my* situation?  My outfit?](else:)[  Was it all worth it, at least?  Do you make that deal?]"

Still looking uneasy, and even glancing around as if to check if anyone else had witnessed your lewd display, Corinth nevertheless appears ready to give you the chance to explain.

"I *know* you do," she replies, in a surprisingly hushed tone.  You get the sense that she's struggling deeply with something, but it takes her a moment to collect herself, to address the issue directly."

Corinth looks to you, her masked gaze meeting your own.  A moment passes and your friend looks liable to burst, which she does with a sudden reply.

"**Yes!**"

In a rush she steps forward, wrapping her arms around you, seizing you in a firm embrace.  The black laminate of her slave suit presses against your own laminate, glossy materials gliding against each other effortlessly.  Her corseted posture is exquisite, (if: $Slave is true or $Brand is true)[matching your own enforced posture,] pressing her chest into you freely.

Despite her confession, that seems a bit too far for Corinth to admit to herself.  *Yet.*  You sense a smile behind her mask despite it all, but she moves to refocus the conversation.

"This whole situation has... consequences for me.(if: $Slave is true)[  For us both, with your suit too.](if: $Servant is true)[ For us both, with that collar around your throat.]  But I can show you that in a moment, in the meantime you need tell me if it all worked out.

Turning on her heel, Corinth leads you deeper into the customs terminal.  The protest you had seen earlier seems to be slowing down, if only because several Truant Officers have intervened, breaking up the gathering with what appears to be a firm application of shock batons.  Their leader, the woman who had been speaking, seems to be speaking with one of the Officers.

Another interesting sight is passed on your left, a small glassed room set into one of the alcove-like protrusions from the main hall, the sign above vague but intriguing: *Celeste Academy*.

"Over here," Corinth intervenes, grabbing your wrist to pull you off the main path.  She's heading towards two banks of large glass screens.  The first bank is attracting all sorts of travelers, while at the second only those clad in laminate and bearing collars-- or the standardized slave suits-- seem to gather.

She looks to you, as if needing that confirmation before indicating the rest of the customs terminal.  "There is a wardrobe machine out there, but I checked, and it requires more credits then I have to remove a suit like this."

Deep into the night, the lines snaking away from the final Aekoran checkpoint before entering the international zone abutting the Way Up proper aren't particularly long.  Most of those you watch pass through are actually *entering* the exclusion zone, in fact, which made sense given your own ticket offworld-- scheduled for midnight, a fresh ride down must have just arrived full of tourists.  Presumably the space elevator's technicians would be preparing for the reverse acent at that very moment.

Still, to pass through the checkpoint would require an absolutely spotless record.  Anything worthy of arrest would undoubtedly get you pulled aside, to be subjected to the altogether rough mercies of the Ministry of Truants.

You had glimpsed it earlier, while discussing with Corinth: something that stood out amongst the various small shops and eateries lining the Customs Enclave.  *Celeste Academy*, the sign had read, and picking it out from the crowd you approach it again.  The outer facade is glass, clean and gleaming, that accents well the sparse interior.  Indeed, the room is mostly empty space excepting a small water feature in the center.  Even your battered memory can recall how expensive water rights could be, making it a copious display of wealth.

*Just what was this place?*

As if to answer that, a woman sits patiently before you, running a red gloved hand slowly through the water.  Ripples spread outward in tight little circles.

She's seated at a small table, dressed in a simply yet elegant black laminate catsuit.  Her particular design has a front zipper, which is pulled down low.   Sipping for a cup of tea, she doesn't seem to acknowledge your standing in the cafe's doorway.

As you approach the Officer storms away in disgust, while the woman you had seen leading the protest from afar remains behind, offering a rude gesture to the Officer's back-- a rare lack of distinct disrespect.

You will almost certainly be found guilty, and with your crime?  That's instant revocation of your legal rights, followed by enslavement."

"Yeah," the other one chimes in.  "Much of the funding for our Ministry actually comes from the auctioning of girls like you, after a bit of training of course.  You know, as a soubrette, or concubine, ponygirl... maybe you'll just be bought by someone needing an office girl.  Running errands, filing reports, sucking cock..."

Despite having awoken tied to your own rented bed, without a credit to your name, you've made it.  You're free, beyond the grasping shackles of Torean society, it's strange culture and restraints.  And you've done it gracefully, passing freely through a checkpoint that *should* have tripped up so many.  Those collared or wanted or with credits to their name would have been turned back, or worse, arrested.  But you're **free**, and the galaxy awaits...

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you've been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant's uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you've grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)["Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now."

*This is a standardized Slave-Rated Wardrobe outfit, as described in the Aekoran Slave Codes, Chapter 812, subsection 10.  Wearing this uniform will subject all Slaves to High Protocol Laws as described in the Aekoran Slave Code, Chapter 679.  Freewombs wearing this uniform will be subjected to portions of the Slave Code, and certain liberties may be revoked.*

Accessories are listed as the pictured corset, heels, regulation mask, posture collar, and (non-pictured) inserts.  The corset is noted as featuring 'real steel' boning, and is custom-measured to match standard Torean expectations of functional corsetry.  So too does the posture collar proudly proclaim its core as beein 'real steel', as well as meeting all Aekoran slave law requirements.  The heels are listed as six inches in height, with one inch platforms.  The mask is simply described as rated for Torean storms, as well as regulating oxygen intake.  And the inserts?  Those are described as front and rear installation, custom-molded for maximum stimulation.  All devices feature 10 hour self-release locks.

On one hand it would a terribly strict crash course in Torean culture for the shopkeeper, but on the other...

Heeled and corseted, she's clearly struggling to breath from the latter's influence, alongside the restriction provided by her mask.  She meets your eyes with shock in her own gaze, tugging ineffectually at her new uniform.

"Well... I..." for one who made her credits calling out to passing customers, you seem to have robbed the words from her.  Instead she twists and turns, admiring herself, a heeled shoe lifting as she shifts her posture.

She leans forward as a result, moaning loudly, the movement only furthering the effect.  It leaves her panting afterward, even as her hands move to her mask, trying to pull it off.  The locks she eventually finds makes it clear that isn't happening soon.

:: BalletRemove [Debt]
Selecting the option for ballet removal, you enter the Wardrobe Device.  It does not take long, the Wardrobe's dissolving liquid being applied ankle down to reduce your heels to little more then a slurry that glides down the drain at the bottom.  In their place a set of boots are printed onto you, stilletos with a slight platform at the toe, but compared to your ballet boots they're a *considerable* improvement. 
(set: $debt to it - 50)(set: $Ballet to false)
Emerging, you no longer are forced to walk so carefully.

[[You return to the Wardrobe's console.->CustomWard2]]


:: PlugRemoval [Debt]
Selecting the option for plug removal, you enter the Wardrobe Device.  It does not take long, and soon you emerge feeling distinctly different-- no longer are you burdened with the sense of phallic intruders between your legs.  For the moment your body betrays you, womanhood drooling in their absence, but you get the sense that will pass shortly.
(set: $debt to it - 50)(set: $Plugs to false)
At the very least you can walk without the occasional moan, now. 

[[You return to the Wardrobe's console.->CustomWard2]]

Selecting the option for thigh removal, you enter the Wardrobe Device.  It does not take long, a simple set of shears built into an armature gliding between thigh and band to cut them free.  
(set: $debt to it - 50)(set: $Wet to false)
Emerging, you no longer announce yourself lewdly with every step.

[[You return to the Wardrobe's console.->CustomWard2]]


:: SSRemoval [Debt]
You're seized as soon as you enter, the door snapping shut behind.  Much like the hotel's Wardrobe, this one has a drain in the bottom of the unit, its use revealed by the first stage of your re-dressing-- the removal.  Instead of peeling the laminate from your body, a simple solvant is applied by a spraying arm, and in mere moments the material is dripping off your body like so much wet paint.  

Removing your plugs is a different matter-- that requires a pair of arms to seize them directly, but as you squirm in your restraints they're pulled free from your tortured cunt.  You take a deep breath, the first in some time, as you are no longer masked.  A brief, tantalizing taste of nudity follows... but not for long.  With a fresh whirl, the Wardrobe begins working on your new outfit as a ring descends from above.

Thus your outfit is quiet literally printed on, first applying bright white but transitioning to an equally vibrant shade of red as it passes your waist and forms a stylish pencil skirt.  The ring descending bit by bit, rendering soft flesh into equally soft but so very *different* laminate.  Secondary arms follow it down, providing spot treatment along seams and friction points-- although often the effect is for merely aesthetic purposes.  Sometimes that takes the form of a second application of laminate, other times it lingers to produce something more substantial-- such as the small folded collar just beneath your chin, or the buttons that almost immediately strain to keep your bust constained by your bodice.

You're given no time to rest as the base layer concludes, the ring rapidly ascending as other arms move into the space to begin work on your accessories.  The peplum skirt you saw pictured is thus formed, starting with the belt at your waist.  Small pre-forged rivets are sunk into the still molton laminate before it is sealed, as is the belt loop that is seated directly over your naval.  Still held in place, small arms flair the laminate that extends over your rear, achieving the look most of the galaxy would label as *slutty* but Torei saw as merely coquettish.

The final componenent of your outfit comes with the sensation of your own feet rising, the sensation unequal and focused primarily at your heel.  Without the restraint arms you would have toppled over, but they hold you tight, tall heels being extruded into place.  More red laminate follows, coating your feet excepting the stylish hole at the very front.

Almost as an afterthought, makeup is applied last.  Mechanical arms seize your head, holding it tight as nozzles approach your face.  A quick blast of air instinctively causes your eyes to close, and in that brief moment the Wardrobe does its work.  Your eyelids have been darkened, a crimson secondary coat added that flashed only when light slid across it.  Pores and blemishes have been rendered impotent as well, while your cheekbones have been highlighted.  And your lips are now a poignant, inviting red.
(set: $Plugs to false)(set: $Slave to false)(set: $Sec to true)(set: $debt to it - 250)
Then, with a final flash of white light and a conclusive hiss, the armatures withdraw.

[[You emerge...->SSRemoval2]]


:: WardPunish
Just what the Wardrobe Device could do to you so far from Club Lush is demonstrated by the sudden jolt of fire that erupts between your legs, the piercing embedded in your clit emitting a shock to your sensative nub powerful enough to send your knees quaking.  Your hands go between your legs almost of their own accord, quickly coming up against the panties beneath your scandalously short skirt.  You yelp, but the Wardrobe hardly cares, instead displaying distinct text.

"Yes," the textile seller admits.  "Many outfits are time-locked upon this world, and while my shears cannot cut through metal, it should make it through *your* outfit easily enough!  Much cheaper then paying a Wardrobe Machine to remove time-locks early, you must understand.  And the only way I can even entice some buyers... 400 credits is quite a bit for most people.  But... let's not discuss this, alright?  I'd rather not a Truant Officer overhear us.  Let me remind you of what I'm selling instead!"

:: NarcHub
Torean communication technology lagged behind galactic standards, even relative to the planet's status as an isolated backwater of sorts.  That made finding a means of contacting Officer Nikaido difficult, but you eventually find a video comm station.  Instead of using numbers or contact addresses however, your activating of the system brings you to an actual human operator.  The tight laminate of her uniform and the collar around her throat indicate this industry relied on physical labor, like so many other Torean stables.

"Good evening, Mistress.  Who are you looking to contact?"

You step back out of the wardrobe, utterly transformed.  Once more you're allowed to breathe freely, regulation no longer being applied by mask and corset.  You've also been liberated from the consistent teasing of the infernal plugs, although curiously your tortured womanhood almost seems to ache from their absence.  Most importantly, though, you will no longer be recognized as little better then a slave-- the outfit you're now wearing instead at least approaches the Torean definition of *professional.*

[[Free at last!->CustomWard2]]


:: WardPunish2
(if: $Strike is 0)[At the behest of the machine, you enter its small chamber for your punishment.  Instead of the usual emergence of arms to restrain you however, the device's interior screen merely displays another command as the door behind you closes, clicking as it locks.]

*The slave will take a kneeling position, legs spread, back straight, hands behind head.*

[[Comply.->WardPunish3]]
[[Stay standing.  Screw this.->WardPunishNN]]


:: WardPunishNo
The Wardobe Device certainly did not have ears, even mechanical ones, to hear you-- but it clearly could tell you had not entered its closet-like interior yet.  It responds simply, and in a manner you are wholly incapable of resisting: with another shock.

With your clit already aching, this second one hurts even more, even if the actual voltage wasn't any different.

*Enter the Wardrobe.*

[[Follow the command, reluctantly.->WardPunish2]]
[["Stop it!"->WardPunishNo2]]

Clearly you're not a particularly quick learner.  The only response is another shock, this time eliciting a quiet moan.  You do not have the means to remove your piercing, and it's clear this treatment will continue until you sate the damned machine.

[[Follow the command, with deep reluctance.->WardPunish2]]


:: WardPunish3
You take a kneeling position, the Wardrobe's interior providing just enough space for the position.  Straightening your back reveals the very limited length of your skirt, the gap of flesh between it and your stockings starkly visible.  Reaching up you place your hands behind you head, gloves pressed against your tightly styled hair.  The position thrusts out your chest, the blue laminate covering it pulled tightly across your breasts.  (if: $Pierced is true)[Your pierced nipples are quite evident.]

Only then does an arm from the Wardrobe deploy behind you, it's purpose unclear-- your position and skirt hide it from view.  The touchscreen meanwhile continues to issue commands.

*You will speak aloud the following:  "I am a slave..."*

In its wake your cunt throbs, the pain now lingering.](if: $Strike is 3)[A third shock since entering, and the effect is adding up quickly.  Your legs quiver, yet conversely you sense a bit of dampness-- is this making you wet?](if: $Strike is 4)[Again you're shocked, the burning sensation from your clit now remaining almost constant.  You're panting too, unable to take much more.](if: $Strike is 5)[A fifth shock, and your will to resist collapses.  You cannot escape your own piercing, and the machine utterly lacks mercy.

Yet another swat, your punishment proving to be unrelenting.  Holding the posture demanded is hard, and you seem to overcompensate by thrusting your chest out even further, as if such simple pleasure could please the Wardrobe.

Instead of another strike from the paddle-armed device behind you, instead you can hear it folding back into place behind its hidden paddle.  The *lack* of another paddling seems to hurt all the more, however, the nerves of your pert rear struggling to understand the change.  The Wardrobe, meanwhile, has one last command-- although this one appears optional.

*You may now beg for a reward, if you will be a good girl.*

[[Hold your pose.  "Please... I promise... to be a good girl."->WardPunishEndGood]]

The machine doesn't go *that* far this time, but you are rewarded with a purr of sweet sensation emerging from your clit instead of a shock.  It's a feeling that seems to ride your nerves straight to the pleasure center of your brain, a hearty moan emerging from your lips in response.

Afterward the machine's door opens behind you, momentarily exposing your submissive pose to those passing by before you stand and emerge.

Her ignoring you is overcome immediately by your taking of the empty seat.  To the woman's credit she does not turn away, and indeed her brows even rise, the serious expression she had been holding flirting with a bit of mirth.

"My, you are a *bold* one.(if: $Slave is true)[  Even while wearing such an... intensive outfit.](if: $Servant is true)[  Even with a collar around your neck.]  That bolds well, I think.  Please then, make yourself comfortable I suppose.  We have something to discuss."

So near the way up, the cafe is filled by tourists, only a few of them in laminate-- perhaps explaining why so many stare at you as you perform a Torean norm: kneeling submissively, waiting for a woman you presumed to be your superior to acknowledge you.

"Well," the catsuited woman begins, pausing to take one last sip of tea before settling in for business.  "I suppose you're wondering why I flagged you down, after you utilized those kiosks?"

She leans back, legs crossed beneath the table, very much at ease.

If you managed it well, the woman is clearly unimpressed, but she does finally meet your gaze.  "Good girl.  You may take a seat.  Arch that back a bit, show off those tits."

She holds up a hand, the half-glove there slick and shiny.  "Before I do, there is something I need to make perfectly clear to you."

Standing where you are now sitting allows Anastasia to loom over you, hands upon the table.  "You will **not** fuck with me.  The Truant Officers here answer to me.  This little enclave is, for all intents and purposes, my personal little fief.  Do I make myself perfectly clear?"

"Such a precious thing you are," Anastasia purrs.  "A proper little doll.  Given more time, I would enjoy playing with you.  But I *do* wish to discuss with you just what I can offer you.  I sense you may be just the sort I keep an eye out for, as a... Travel Agent."

Otherwise you may take your leave as you will, I am always here."

Waving for the cafe's laminate-uniformed attendent, she orders another cup of tea.

[[Anastasia's travel agency is open for business.->CustomSmug]]


:: SmugShip
"Ah, yes," Anastasia responds.  "My most popular option.  Let us say you seek to leave Torei, but you cannot pass through customs.  Why?  I hardly care.  But you must, and I can provide, no questions asked.  For the low cost of 450 credits you will be packaged as slaves so frequently are, for delivery.  And that is how your crate will be marked.  But upon shipment your crate will be... lost, only to be found on the far side of the border, where Torean laws no longer apply.  There you will be freed, given a new ticket for the Way Up, and our business will conclude."
(if: $Wanted is 2)[

:: SmugKey
"My *key* service is not one I recommend, but I understand some prospective travellers are operating under strict budgets."  Anastasia reaches down, pulling a small keycard from somewhere near her hip.  Holding it up before you, small letters appear emblazoned upon it:

*International Port Authority*

"Between this terminal and the international zone is the customs checkpoint, of course, but to either side are open gardens to which I can provide access, and a copy of this keycard-- which will get you into the otherwise securely locked door on the far side of said garden.  All for the low cost of 100 credits."

She twists her wrist sharply, sliding the card back down and out of the way.  "I recommend my shipping services over this, however, because the garden itself is guarded, and we have never attempted this as of yet.  You would be required to reach the far side of your own accord, and I do hate providing a service I cannot guarantee.  Still-- outrun or outsmart the guards, make it through that door, and they will not be able to touch you.  Fail..."

She shrugs her shoulders, as if that could speak for itself.

[["...right."->CustomSmug]]
[["...yes."->CustomSmug]]


:: SmugShipCor
Anastasia nods immediately.  "Of course... although I do not do bulk discounts, you must understand.  For a second shipment it would cost an additional 450 credits, thus 900 total for you both-- or you could choose to merely ship this other person instead.  It matters not to me."
(set: $CorShip to true)
You keep this in mind, to discuss with Corinth later.

[["Got it."->SmugShip]]


:: SmugShipAsk
"Travel time varies," Anastasia explains.  "So as to not arouse suspicion.  On average you would be within the crate... for perhaps a week?  Maybe more.  Given you're packaged in the same manner as an actual slave enduring long-distance shipment, you will of course be provided with nutrition.  Torean slave slurry tastes quite horrid, I've been told, but it will keep you fed and watered."

*One to two weeks!*

[["Right..."->SmugShip]]


:: SmugShipAsk2
"Trust that you won't simply be shipped to some horrid antipodal plantation, to serve as a field slave?"  Anastasia grins, a wicked expression on her lips.  "You have no guarantees, of that I must admit.  But you wouldn't be discussing this if you had better options, I imagine."

She leans back.  "To assuage your fears however... I will say that a particular Society works with me, using my services to help slaves... *travel.*  If I am good enough for them, I should be good enough for you."

[[She has a point.->SmugShip]]


:: SmugShip2
She asks for your ID, pressing it against her *glass* device.  "It seems you *do* have the credits," she confirms, with predatory glee.  "Wonderful.  Well-- if this is truly your desire, you need only say the word.  But be warned, you will be taken for shipment preparation immediately, so if there is anything else you wish to do in Aekora, you best do it now."

(if: $CorSlave is true and $CorStat is 5)[This would mean leaving Corinth behind, almost certainly dooming her to eventual slavery.]

[["Okay, let me think about it some more."->SmugShip]]


:: SmugShip3 [Debt]
(set: $debt to it - 450)"Excellent," Anastasia replies, tapping out a command into her glass.  Then she waits, patiently, until the requisite credits are indeed drained from your account.  Once it does, you're treated to perhaps Anastasia's first pleased expression-- although quickly it turns predatory.  She leans over table, one hand upon it. 

"We will begin prepping you for shipment immediately.  All you *need* to do is tell the woman at the counter you want 'the slave's special.'"

Turning your head, you look across the small cafe to where the cafe's attendent is slowly cleaning out a teacup.  She looks bored.

[["Okay, I can do that."->SmugShip4]]
[["That's it?"->SmugShip4]]


:: SmugShip4 [End-Count]
Anastasia nods, then leans back with her teacup, pointedly dismissing you with her sudden disinterest.  Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

"What will it be, ma'am?"  The attendant asks.
(set: $Ending to 3)
[["The... slave's special?"->SmugShip5]]


:: SmugShip5
The attendent perks up at that, looking over your shoulder to where Anastasia remains seated.  To the unasked question the 'travel agent' nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

"Well then," she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  "Follow me."

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.

[[You're committed now.  Follow her!->SmugShip6]]


:: SmugShip6
The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe's various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you've used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Picking up a glassboard hanging from the side of the wardrobe, the attendant flicks through several pages.  "Hmmm... ah, lucky you.  Next scheduled pickup is for a trained fuckdoll slave.  Academy-certified and everything.  That means... the violet outfit..."

She taps upon the Wardrobe's control panel.  "...boots... makeup... gag... there!"

Turning to you, she uses the glassboard to gesture towards the maw of the waiting Wardrobe.  "Well?  In ya go."

[["Wait-- what kind of slave?"->SmugShip7Ex]]
[["I'm not going in there!"->SmugShip7Resist]]
[["Right... okay."->SmugShip7]]


:: SmugShip7Ex
"Hmm?  Oh!"  The attendent looks to you, then raps the nearest crate with the back of her hand.  "We use different boxes, different claims of what sort of slaves are being shipped-- anything to throw off the Ministry.  You're going in as an Academy fuckdoll, a slave who has been trained as a very dutiful sort of concubine.  But that's just your cover, of course!  All you need to do is look the part."

She repeats the gesture towards the Wardrobe.  "So... in ya go!"

[["I'm not going in there!"->SmugShip7Resist]]
[["Right... okay."->SmugShip7]]


:: SmugShip7Resist
The attendent frowns a bit.  "It's... a bit late for that.  Usually the people who do this *need* to leave, don't you?  To get into the international zone?  Well this is the way it's going to happen.  So... get in there."

[["Wait-- what kind of slave?"->SmugShip7Ex]]
[["Right... okay."->SmugShip7]]


:: SmugShip7
With a last hesitant look towards the attendent, you step into the makeship Wardrobe-- and it responds as you had perhaps expected, with a plethora of arms.  Seizing hold of you they begin the systematic removal of your current oufit, but abstain from the (perhaps expensive) solvents used by other machines.  Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.

Above you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one in a purple shade that quickly proves to be semi-transparent.  Black is then chosen for your accessories, which are formed more slowly.  At your feet ballet heels are extruded and then connected to knee high boots, while at your waist an underbust corset is installed, then tightened cruelly by the Wardrobe itself.  

Afterward your arms are pulled back and layers of laminate applied upon them, linking them together in a single-sleeve armbinder that both prevents any usage of your arms *and* proves decidedly uncomfortable in mere moments.  Progressing further up a posture collar, also in black, is printed for around your throat.  With it in place, running firmly from jaw to collarbone, you cannot turn your head nor look down.  Makeup follows, violet lipstick being applied to your lips, eyeliner and blush accompanying-- while large fake eyelashes ensure a permanently sultry look.

The final component is a gag, a large black ball being seated behind your teeth as straps are printed to hold it firmly in place by snapping into place behind your head.  Annoyingly, a tube seems to emerge from the back of the ball, tickling your throat slightly.  Only then does the Wardrobe release you back out into the backroom.

[[You emerge...->SmugShip8]]


:: SmugShip8
You step out of the Wardrobe Device (if: $Ballet is true)[in a display of dexterity, having grown accustomed to ballet heels](else:)[stumbling and nearly falling over given your shoes.]  Intended to keep you permantently *en pointe*, they're already competing with the strict pull of your new armbinder for the title of 'most uncomfortable.'

Noticing your emergence, the attendant looks to you with a smile, standing over a long crate now laying upon the floor, the pink foam within holding a distinctly feminine silhouette.

"Look at you," she muses, settling her hands on your corseted waist.  "You're just a feminine little doll now, hm?"

(link-reveal: "No I'm not!")[[[  "Mmmmmgh!"->SmugShip9]]]
(link-reveal: "I have to wear all this?!")[[[  "Mmhhmmgh!"->SmugShip9]]]
(link-reveal: "How do I look?")[[[  "Mhhmgh?"->SmugShip9]]]


:: SmugShip9
"Well, the gag clearly works," the attendant laughs.  Brushing a bit of your own hair from your eyes, she glides her hands up the violet laminate of your chest.  It's a simple tease, and one she doesn't linger on before turning to present you to the box upon the floor.

"Now, be a good doll and move up beside your box.  Printed the foam insert to your exact measurements, while you were inside the Wardrobe.  Should be nice and comfy... for awhile, at least."

[["Mmmmggh?"->SmugShip10a]]
[["Mmmmgh..."->SmugShip10a]]
[[Let her guide you to the box.->SmugShip10]]


:: SmugShip10a
"I *really* can't understand you with that gag in," the attendent notes.  "You really should practice your gag talk."

*Was that a thing?*

[[Let her guide you to the box.->SmugShip10]]


:: SmugShip10
Given your bondage it takes a good bit of effort and assistance from the attendant, but eventually you find yourself laying in the box just tall enough to fit you.  The foam padding beneath you is indeed rather comfortable, even providing a perfectly shaped indent for your bound arms.  What's decidedly less comfortable is the lead she connects to the front of your ballgag, the tube positioned down your throat now serving a clear purpose, as she loads a small jug of some sort of liquid into the box beside your head.  Food.

Further restraints follow, black straps anchored in the box emerging to snap tightly across your body at ankle, hips, waist, and throat.

"There--" the attendent concludes, placing two more items in the insets apparently designed just for them.  "Accessories... extra gag, and a vibrating wand.  Done!  One counterfeit Academy-grade fuckdoll, all pretty and packed up.  You just need your lid, and you're lucky, dolls get a *view.*"

<img src="img/LHncakj.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

To demonstrate she holds up the lid for your box, which indeed does have a clear panel that would expose you from waist to head.  The pink graphics and label mark the contents as *Fuckdoll Slave*, *A Fully Trained Torean Doll*, and *A Product of Celeste Academy*.

Unable to move, there is little you can do as the lid slotted into place upon your box, then secured with several heavy locks.

[["Mmmgh..."->SmugShip11]]


:: SmugShip11
Through the window of your crate, the attendant waves with a smile.  "Package pickup is the morning, but you're all set for..." she has the glassboard again, consulting it.  "Ah, tough luck.  Longer route.  Well-- enjoy your time as a doll, you're looking at perhaps two weeks of it."

Tapping your crate, she turns back to return to the cafe's front.

[["Mmmmmghh!"->SmugShip12]]
[[Remain silent.  It's no use."->SmugShip12]]


:: SmugShip12
As promised, they come for you in the morning-- two men, wearing simple laminate overalls.  They very much look the part of basic labor and act like it, working together to lift your box.  The restraints and foam work cooperatively to limit your jostling, and if your toes weren't so strictly pointed and your arms not bent back it would have almost been comfortable.

Instead of taking you back through the cafe they carry your display box through some manner of backend tunnel before eventually spilling out onto a public thoroughfare, where a flatbed truck awaits.  There you're loaded alongside a variety of other packages and crates, little more then property being moved from one place to another.  Placed on your back looking up towards the sky, you're given your first (at least that you could recall) view of the Way Up stretching towards the heavens through the window of your box.  You're *so* close, and yet in laminate and restraints, boxed like a perfect little doll, you might as well be a thousand miles away.  

Slowly it starts to recede as the delivery truck moves.

[[One of the porters appears above you.->SmugShip13]]


:: SmugShip13
"You know the worst part, Arnst?" He asks to his partner, presumably driving the truck up front.  "When they make us haul one of these girls who are worth more then we make in a *year*, you know?"

The other man, presumably Arnst, seems to suggest a shrug by tone alone.  "Don't kick yourself about it, everyone knows those Academy fuck dolls are overpriced."

The man above you meets your eyes through the clear portion of your box.  "I don't know, I heard they're pretty well trained."

You may have been staring at him, but he seems content to treat you as almost inanimate. 

[[Moan lewdly, arch your back.->SmugShip14A]]
[[Remain silent.->SmugShip14B]]


:: SmugShip14A
Playing to the role assigned, you act the doll, moaning into your gag as you arch your back.  Your bondage prevents much movement, but your chest is thrust up a bit for his pleasure.  The man catches the sound and movement, a hand coming to his chin, as if in thought.

"Slutty little thing."

Arnst, up front, calls again.  "You better stop fantasizing about owning the girl, and get back to work.  Certainly you won't see her again, did you see that manifest?  She's going far out into the Antipodes."

The man above you sighs.  "I bet she'd be a fun time..."

Time passes dreadfully slowly, in your box.  Eventually you're offloaded from the truck, entering a processing center of some sort.  You catch the glimpse of the occasional collared slave peeking into your display box, but most simply seem focused on their work-- and soon you're being loaded into the baggage compartment of a train.

That's even worse, the barest hint of interesting locales replaced by a darkened interior.  Sometime later, you think its night, you finally work up the courage to suckle on the tube hanging from your gag-- and are rewarded with a foul slurry that runs down your throat.  Apparently the food of slaves, but all you can attest to is that it's thankfully filling.  You don't need to eat much.

And thus a cycle developes, your drifting into fitful sleep only to be awakened by the rattle of the train.  When hungry you suck out some more of the nutriant slurry.

[[Slowly the hours become days... a week passes.->SmugShip16]]


:: SmugShip16
The train slows... but are you caught in a dream?  It's been getting hard to tell the difference between the waking reality of your dark compartment and your sleep that seems filled with much the same.  That you're awake becomes clear as you feel the ache in your arms and legs, a telltale sign soon replaced by blinding *light.*

"Transit number... yeah, there it is," a female voice declares, just before hands settle upon your box.  You're pulled out into the blinding light of day, although thankfully you're propped up against the side of the train instead of staring up directly into that burning sun.

You're on a train platform of some sort, rolling fields of green stretching out across the horizon.  Before you stands something downright terrifying, however-- a pair of Truant Officers.

*Has the plan come apart?  You can't even run!*

[[They begin unlocking your display box.->SmugShip17]]

<img src="img/iQB9t2X.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

"Be careful," one Officer admonishes the other, adjusting her cap.  "Don't scratch that box, you know what our orders say."

"Yeah, yeah," the shorter one replies, standing back up as they work together to remove your lid.  After a week, the fresh air that enters is heavenly-- and feels nearly as good as your fears of discovery being quickly squashed.

"Pull the box, affix a new label, change the tracker inside," the Officer continues, as if speaking a carefully prepared script.  "We've done this a hundred times, stop worrying."

"I *always* worry with these dolls," the partner responds.  "Most of these jobs are just cheap auction trash, but only the rich would own one of these slaves.  Imagine messing that up."

The bolder one rolls her eyes, then reaches down, plucking the vibrator wand in your box-- listed as an included accessory-- out from its slot.  Her other hand settles on your hip, the smooth curve emphasized by the corset still embracing you so tightly.

"Stop.  Worrying!"

"See how well trained these are?" The bolder Officer asks, having noticed your subdued response.  "She's been in there for a week, and what happens the moment I grab this vibe?  She wants it."

*Had that been your intent?*

"They're *trained* to want it, or to act like they do," the partner responds.  "Come on, se--"

She's ignored by the wand-armed Officer.  "Do you want the vibe, doll?  It would be a terrible burden, locked in your cute little box.  But you would be all nice at wet for your Master, or Mistress-- whoever owns you."

"Oh, that sounds like a *yes*," the Officer grins, only for her partner to intercede.  "No-- that was distinctly a *no*, and you know it."

"Don't be like that," comes the response.  "Come on, you know she deserves it.  No one ends up as one of these fuck dolls without thinking solely with her cunt."

The partner looks to you, then sighs.  "Fine, but seal her back in afterward.  She has to be on the train back to Grand Aekora in like, a half hour."

And with that she departs, leaving you with the Officer-- and the vibrating wand.

"Oh, that sounds like a *yes*," the Officer grins, only for her partner to intercede.  "Huh, you're right, that was."

"Told you," comes the response.  "Come on, you know she deserves it.  No one ends up as one of these fuck dolls without thinking solely with her cunt."

The partner looks to you, then sighs.  "Fine, but seal her back in afterward.  She has to be on the train back to Grand Aekora in like, a half hour."

And with that she departs, leaving you with the Officer-- and the vibrating wand.

[["Mmmghh..."->SmugShip19]]


:: SmugShip19
You have no more the means to resist then a doll, and the Officer knows it.  Sliding the wand up between your legs, your own thighs pulled so tightly together by the intervening straps ensuring it could not move, she grins brightly.

"How's that?  Not good enough, I bet.  You want it *on*."  And with a flick of her thumb, it is, the rounded tip vibrating fiercly.  You can feel it in your thighs, and much more alarmingly against the zipper guarding your womanhood-- such defenses providing little actual help as the assaulting waves of sensation begin working through you.

"Better?  Good."  Pulling your lid back over, she slots it into place upon your box.  The locks are reinstalled afterward, as a bit of drool runs down your chin.  Once again you're looking out the plastic panel that was your box's display port, through which the Officer looks.

She waves.  "Enjoy your trip back the other way, dolly..."

[["Mmmmmmmmmmgggh!"->SmugShip20]]
[["Mnngh!"->SmugShip20]]


:: SmugShip20
The vibrator is not positioned particularly well, making any real attempt at orgasm difficult-- but it does prove *relentless.*  Eventually you're loaded back into another train compartment, returned to the relative darkness with other pieces of luggage, but the wand makes settling into your previous routine difficult.  Despite your best intentions the vibrator is making you wet, inducing an ache in your loins that keeps you up at night.  Even your meals, such as they are, are interrupted on occasion by a twitch of your hips.  

It just felt so *good*, and knowing you couldn't remove the damned thing only made it worse.

[[And the train rumbles on.->SmugShip21]]


:: SmugShip21
Moaning quietly in your little box, the doll you had been forced to imitate can only endure.  But endure you do, two weeks of mindnumbing immobility, strict bondage, and tight laminate finally come to an end as you're unloaded once more.   Just *where* you are isn't clear until your box is positioned upright upon a handcart, a man apparently signing for you before leaning you back to begin walking.  Above you the Way Up looms, close-- so very close.

Eventually you enter into a door, moving down several side passages before coming to a stop inside what appears to be a massive warehouse.  Duraplastic containers are stacked all about, almost forming a small ring of privacy within the space your doll box is finally removed from the cart and leaned up against.

Looking in, the man swings a key around his finger.  "Ready to come out?"

[[Surely he jests.->SmugShip22]]


:: SmugShip22
He is.  Working down the locks on each side of your box, he finally removes the lid-- then notices the vibrator, pulling that out first before addressing the straps securing you in place.  Once those are free you try to lurch forward, a firm hand on your shoulder holds you in place-- before he offers a hand.

"Two weeks in that getup, and those boots?  You ain't gonna want to walk, honey."  The truth is evident as you slowly slide free from the custom molding of the box, only to collapse, his strong hands the only thing keeping you upright.  Carefully he guides you over to what appears to be a cot, that he helps you sit down on.  Then he pulls out your gag.

"Welcome to the international zone."

"Yes you did," the man replies.  "And that's after you pulled the bad luck of a... particularly rough trip, and I've seen all sorts of cover stories come through my little port.  "Posing as one of Celeste's pleasure dolls is *not* an easy thing to do.  And I'm sure Anastasia did not tell you about that."

"Oh, right-- name's Jacob," he says.  "I'd shake your hand, but you've got that armbinder on... will probably need to cut that off."

He begins looking through the workbench up alongside one of the containers.

[["What... happens now?"->SmugShip24]]


:: SmugShip24
"Well," he returns to your side, a thin blade in hand.  Pressing it against your armbinder, it comes apart with surprising ease.  "You've made it to your destination.  Two weeks behind schedule and in a *very* interesting manner, but you made it-- just as my better half promised.  Obviously I'm removing your binder, but I don't exactly have clothes for you.  So you'll be wearing that on your way out of here."

He pulls the armbinder away, your arms nearly screaming from the sudden liberty allowed them.  After so long restrained, remaining strictly bound almost seemd the greater mercy.  "So I'll provide you with a ticket for the Way Up, and you can be on your merry way."

[["What do you mean by 'better half'?"->SmugShip25What]]
[["That sounds... great, Jacob."->SmugShip25]]


:: SmugShip25What
"Ah, you met Anastasia I'm presuming?  She's my wife.  She runs her port of departure, so to speak, I run this one for arrival.  My Anastasia's quite the hellcat, but I'm sure you already knew that.  She give you the *don't fuck with me* speech?  Love that one.  It's true, though."

He eyes you.  "You're luckily you didn't mess with her.  But hey, let me grab you that ticket."

[["Sounds good, Jacob."->SmugShip25]]


:: SmugShip25
He disappears around a container's corner, leaving you alone for a brief period.  It's your first time to truly reflect on what you had just endured-- the means by which you had escaped.  Looking down upon the tight laminate still cloaking your body, you work at stretching your arms and working your jaw, both prickling with firey pain as they're allowed to move once more.

Had you truly *enjoyed* the two weeks spent inside that box?  The way all who had looked upon you had seen a *doll* worth thousands of credits, a Torean rarity?  Did freedom not pale a bit when compared to a life lived so strangely, as a thing in glossy laminate, a cherished possession?

It's an idea you wrestle with for some time, until Jacob returns-- a fresh ticket for the way up in his hand.

"My work here is done for the day-- did you want to be escorted to the Way Up's gates?"  He asks, indicating the leashes hung along the wall.  "It's not the way they do it out here, of course, but some girls who come through... just can't shake the Torei from themselves."

[["...yes, sir."->SmugShip26]]


:: SmugKeyHowMany
"Oh, quite a few I would imagine" Anastasia responds nonchalantly.  Clearly she wasn't downplaying the risks.  "But the distance between the access point I would provide and your target door would not be *too* far.  You will probably make it."

She holds up a hand, as if to examine the back of her half-glove.  "And if not, I've still been paid.  A risk or reward scenario, hm?"

[[Those don't sound like great odds.->SmugKey]]


:: SmugKeyCau
"I ditch my copy of the key, and stop providing that little service."

There's a long moment of silence before she continues.  "Oh-- perhaps you meant what would happen to you?  Arrest, most certainly.  Followed by a trial, and almost certainly revocation of you rights and thus a Ringdom-mandated collar.  We Toreans do take our border security seriously, I'll have you know."

[[Not seriously enough to stop smuggling across it, though.->SmugKey]]


:: SmugKeyCor
Anastasia nods immediately.  "Of course... although the chances of you being caught do go up, so I would insist on doubling the price to 200 credits.  Or, if this other person wishes to utilize my services alone, it would remain 100.  You need only send them my way."
(set: $CorRun to true)
You keep this in mind, to discuss with Corinth later.

[["I have other questions.->SmugKey]]


:: SmugKey2
She asks for your ID, pressing it against her *glass* device.  "It seems you *do* have the credits," she confirms, with predatory glee.  "Wonderful.  Well-- if this is truly your desire, you need only say the word.  But be warned, you will be taken to utilize my key immediately, so if there is anything else you wish to do in Aekora, you best do it now."
(if: $CorSlave is true and $CorStat is 5)[This would mean leaving Corinth behind, almost certainly dooming her to eventual slavery.]

[["Okay, let me think about it some more."->SmugKey]]


:: SmugKey3 [Debt]
(set: $debt to it - 100)"Excellent," Anastasia replies, tapping out a command into her glass.  Then she waits, patiently, until the requisite credits are indeed drained from your account.  Once it does, you're treated to perhaps Anastasia's first pleased expression-- although quickly it turns predatory.  She leans over table, one hand upon it. 

"You will be departing immediately-- the cover of darkness perhaps helping.  All you need to do is tell the woman at the counter you want 'to take a walk.'"

Turning your head, you look across the small cafe to where the cafe's attendent is slowly cleaning out a teacup.  She looks bored.

(if: $CorSlave is true and $CorStat is 5)[This would mean leaving Corinth behind, almost certainly dooming her to eventual slavery.]

[["Okay, I can do that."->SmugKey4]]
[["That's it?"->SmugKey4]]


:: SmugKey4
Anastasia nods, then leans back with her teacup, pointedly dismissing you with her sudden disinterest.  Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

"What will it be, ma'am?"  The attendant asks.

[["I'd... like to take a walk?"->SmugKey5]]


:: SmugKey5
The attendent perks up at that, looking over your shoulder to where Anastasia remains seated.  To the unasked question the 'travel agent' nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

"Well then," she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  "Follow me."

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.

[[You're committed now.  Follow her!->SmugKey6]]


:: SmugKey6
The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe's various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you've used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Your guiding attendant ignores them completely however, instead moving towards an otherwise nondescript wall.  When she presses upon one of the durasteel bricks, however, it shifts-- revealing a hidden door, and a tunnel burrowed into it.

Producing a keycard, she offers it to you.  "Go down the hallway, fourth door-- only one on your right.  The others won't open, so don't try it."

[[Take the card.  "Understood."->SmugKey7]]
[["What about after that?"->SmugKey7A]]


:: SmugKey7
You step into the secret tunnel, only to see the attendant turn back your way.  "Hey-- and good luck.  You'll need it."

And with that she closes the hidden wall, leaving you in darkness.  The gloom reveals small lights set along the floor, providing you with an obvious path forward, but you still need to watch your footing-- the ground is uneven.

One, two, three, you count the doors passed on your left as instructed, until finally coming to another door-- this one on your right.  Placing your hand against (if: $Sec is true or $Textile is true)[you feel it to be a bit chilled by the night air undoubtedly just beyond.](else:)[you feel it to be a bit chilled even through your laminate glove, the undoubtedly from the night air just beyond.]

It's almost midnight, and you're too far along to turn back now.

[[Throw the door open, ready for anything.->SmugThrowDoor]]
[[Gently slide it open, take a peek.->SmugPeek]]


:: SmugKey7A
The attendant steps forward, pressing the keycard into your hand.  "You'll be outside, in the space between this terminal and the Way Up's international zone.  Look for the red door.  Get past that, and you're all gloss."

She gestures for you to leave.  "Now-- go, I need to get back up front in the Cafe."

[[You step towards the door.->SmugKey7]]


:: SmugThrowDoor
Taking Anastasia's suggestion that this entire attempt could quickly devolve into a footrace, you against Truant Agents with your freedom on the line, you throw the door open-- ready for anything.

The darkness of the tunnel meets the quiet dark of the garden beyond, carefully sculpted bushes arranged around a fountain from your point of view, but the sound of the door-- or perhaps your hurried movement-- seems to have drawn immediate attention.  A spotlight suddenly ignites, hellishly bright in comparison, from the rooftop of the Terminal you now stand ready to exit.

Still-- you see your goal in the distance, a door that would have been too dark to make out had it not been for the red light blinking above it.  You're so close-- and the way is remarkably clear, an empty expanse of grass before you.

[[Try to sneak along the edge of the open area.->SmugSneak]]
[[Run for it-- that spotlight will see you eventually!->SmugRun]]


:: SmugPeek
Carefully, mindful of every possible squeak from the archaic sort of hinged door, you work it open.

The darkness of the tunnel meets the quiet dark of the garden beyond, carefully sculpted bushes arranged around a fountain from your point of view.  Oddly, there are no signs of guards-- the way across is nothing more then a broad expanse of grass.

Still-- you see your goal in the distance, a door that would have been too dark to make out had it not been for the red light blinking above it.  You're so close!

[[They will see you anyway, run for it!->SmugRun]]
[[Try to sneak along the edge of the open area.->SmugSneak]]


:: SmugSneak
Cautiously you edge along the side of the grassy plain, a choice that proves well considered when you notice several small metallic *things* gleaming in the grass just before the door you had exited.  Mines of some sort?

Either way you avoid them, but about halfway across another peril befalls you-- a searchlight arcing across the grass, then along the wall you're moving across.  It will reach you any moment.

Staying along the wall is safer, but will expose you-- even running will not escape that rapidly approaching light.  Otherwise you could break out across the grass, watching as best you can for mines.

[[Stay along the wall!->SmugSneak2]]
[[Risk the grass!->SmugRun2]]


:: SmugRun
Breaking from the doorway, you make for the door as fast as you can manage.  Your third step reveals how little speed would matter, however, when several small devices jump up suddenly from the grass.  *Motion-activated mines* your mind identifies, moments before they discharge in a flash of blinding light.

It takes your eyes a good minute to regain vision, but by then you already know you're in trouble.  You had fallen, unable to get up-- the *why* explained when you can finally look down, revealing the thick laminate straps that have wrapped around your body.  A flash of light, binding straps being launched in all directions?  You've fallen into a typical Torean security device, and already you can hear voices approaching as a spotlight upon the Terminal circles your fallen form in a halo of bright light.

[[Struggle!->SmugRunFail]]
[[Lay still, accept your fate.->SmugRunFail]]


:: SmugSpecial2
The Torean smuggler gives a crooked smile.  "There is a prisoner being held here, at this very Terminal, who happens to be stuck in a peculiar situation-- they believe her to be a runaway slave, but she has thus far refused to provide her identity.  Normally this would not be an issue, the Ministry of Truants can be quite patient, but the crux is in how she was detained: attempting to sneak from the international zone *into* Aekora, and thus Torean jurisdiction.  The treaties between the Ringdoms and the international zone are quite clear that anyone in such a position must be returned to their point of origin-- thus this detainee will be returned to the international zone."

Anastasia rubs her hands together, her smile widening.  "But I want her to stay here, in Torei.  So we will make a swap, putting you in the prisoner's cell.  She's gagged and in a full suit, the Officers won't be able to tell the difference-- until they escort you into the international zone, and thus *your* freedom.  I will, meanwhile, retain this mystery prisoner."

[["The Ministry won't just let you make a switch like that."->SmugSpecial3]]
[["How would you manage the swap?"->SmugSpecial3]]


:: SmugSpecial3
"As I've mentioned, the Truant Officers here are *mine*.  Or most of them are.  Such as the one who works nights in the detainment cells, here at the border.  Officer Valroux would not be particularly pleased if I were to spring this on her tonight, but she would comply."

(if: $Wanted is 2)[This sounds *exactly* like the sort of thing Officer Nikaido wanted you to seek out!

Anastasia eyes you with interest.  "So?  If you do wish to pursue this, I would make the swap immediately.  So if you have anything else you wish to do on this side of the border, I would do it now.  But you can't beat free, right?"

"Well, that unfortunately would not be possible," the smuggler explains.  "There is only the one detainee, you must understand.  If you have a second prospective traveller, perhaps we should discuss my other options? They will cost a bit, of course, but I could provide expanded services with those.

[[Well, it was worth a try.->SmugSpecial3]]


:: SmugSpecialWho
Anastasia's brows rise slightly.  "I... have an idea, at the very least.  But that is hardly relevent to your situation, is it?  Simply consider it your good luck that she is present, and we can utilize her in this manner.  Normally my services are rather expensive, after all.  This is an exceptional offer."

[[Clearly she isn't going to explain further.->SmugSpecial3]]


:: SmugSpecialWhat
"Hm... let us simply say that I would have a vested interest in this particular woman remaining with us, in the full slavery she is most probably accustomed to, mind you.  Is that not a fair trade?  Your freedom, for hers?  Why should *she* be granted escape merely because of a quirk of treaty laws?"

Anastasia nods, as if she had convinced herself.  "Better it be you, for everyone involved."

[[A life for a life, so to speak.->SmugSpecial3]]


:: SmugSpecialReally
"I doubt it," Anastasia shrugs.  "The girl has been there for a few weeks now, the law allows for a two month holding period, but that is now ending.  So they will have grown accustomed to her, and with you wearing the identical uniform that I've assembled?  You need only wait out the remaining time."

[["I see."->SmugSpecial3]]


:: SmugSpecial4
Anastasia's eyes flash, and with a sharp movement she drinks the rest of her tea.  "That's just what I wanted to hear.  Let us get to it, then."

Rising, the black-suited smuggler gestures for you to follow across the small cafe.  Approaching the counter, the attendant rushes to lift the portion that allowed access behind-- clearly a subordinate of some sort.

Opening the door that led to the cafe's backroom, she never even glances back before entering.  In her wake you hesitate, until the attendant gestures for you to proceed.

[[You're committed now.->SmugSpecial5]]


:: SmugRunFail
It takes some time for the Truant Officers that find you to extricate you  from your predicaments, but they manage, eventually securing your hands behind your back as they march you back towards the Terminal.  Arrested in the act of an attempted illegal border crossing, you're informed of the gravity of your situation-- and the fact that it will take some time before your trial.  Until then, you will be a guest of the Ministry of Truants.

Despite it all, freedom retreats much like the glimmering Way Up behind you, so close yet now eternally out of reach.  This will earn you a collar, certainly, and who could tell what would happen then?  

You're truly lost in laminate now.

[[Time passes...->SmugRunTrial]]


:: SmugSneak2
You break into a sprint, one hand skating along the wall.  As expected the spotlight lands upon you rather quickly, momentarily overshooting before coming back to you-- perhaps surprised to have found someone.  Alarms in the distance announce you've been discovered, but you're already three quarters of the way to the door, and making good time...

...until gunshot like pops precede canisters falling around you.  From them a thick pink smoke emerges, quickly filling a garden courtyard you now realize was perfectly designed for such a trap.

You break from the wall, eyes firmly upon the ground as you try to dance around the metallic triggers sticking up from the grass.  It proves easier then you expected in fact, as they reflect the searchlight still running quickly along the wall.  But they're not the only waiting trap.

Stepping carefully around a trigger, your (if: $Textile is true)[foot](else:)[heeled boot] hits the grass-- and keeps going down.  You stumble, trying to find your footing, only for your other leg to begin sliding into a similar trap.

You cover the last couple feet barely able to breathe, the mask keeping you from falling to prety to the gas all around still very much regulating your breathing-- by the time you're pressing the card against the door's terminal you can barely focus.  Yet it opens, allowing you to burst inside, slamming the door behind you as a few pink whisps quickly dissipate.

You're greeted with a good hundred or so tourists and offworlders gawking at your laminated form, the intensive bondage of your slave suit very different from most of their textiles.  Before you're forced to explain, however, several uniform Officers push through the crowd-- although thankfully they're not of the Truant variety.

Quickly you pull forth the keycard, positioning it upon the reader... and then simply drop it.

You look down to find your hand trembling.  Had it always been so hot out here?  It certainly is now.  And your legs are growing weak, enough to stumble, leaning against the door you should be opening.  Slowly you slide down, now breathing deeply, panting even, as your hands seem to work of their own accord--- one finding your own breast, the other sliding down between your legs.

Before you one of the canisters burns out, the pink mist now filling the courtyard.  Just what was in that?  And why... why was it making you so **aroused?**  You cannot help yourself, in fact, as you begin fiercly rubbing between your own legs.  (if: $Textile is true)[Your linen clothes do not prove particularly well-suited to this, but still you persist.](else:)[Your laminate glides between your own fingers, your cunt burning with sudden hunger.]

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you've been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant's uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you've grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)["Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.

There are more men in the room you're eventually led to then you've seen all day, and between them they explain your situation.  In short?  You're free.  Already the Ministry of Truants is arguing for your extradition, but the international zone is careful to protect its own rights, and here that helps you immensely.  Everything else bleeds into the backround as you wrestle with that, though: you're *free*.  You've made it!  Despite everything Torei has thrown at you, from the hotel to the streets to the club, you've come out on the other side-- encased in glossy laminate, but *free.*

The outfit they eventually provide is not particularly flashy, but it is about as far from your laminate uniform as could be managed.  Freed from so much glossy material, you return to a state of dignity, the Officers leading you out and releasing you to your promised ticket and the Way Up.

You're no longer lost in laminate.

[[And the Way Up looms...->SlaveEscapeEnd]]


:: SlaveEscapeSuit
Your answer seems to stun the collected security Officers, standing as they are in a circle around you.  Several are very clearly trying to not stare at your laminated form, so tightly sealed, corseted and masked.  Yet they hardly seem ready to argue the point either, your liberty here at least still very much maintained-- even if you chose not to seek *dignity.*

Leading you out to the international concourse, the final Officer gestures that you're truly free to go-- and the Way Up looms above.

[[Be on your way...->SlaveEscapeEnd]]
[[Give him a parting reverence.  "Thank you, sir."->SlaveEscapeRev]]


:: SlaveEscapeEnd
Despite having awoken tied to your own rented bed, without a credit to your name, you've made it.  You're free, beyond the grasping shackles of Torean society, it's strange culture and restraints.  (if: $Slave is true)[(Even if you've retained the uniform.)  ]Perhaps it was careful planning that had led you to attempt that run in the most restrictive and less likely of outfits, perhaps it had been blind luck-- either way, you ran for it and escaped, a fate few others could claim.  Most would not have not had the guts, but you're **free**, and the galaxy awaits...

[[You make your way towards the space elevator.->GoodEnding]]


:: SlaveEscapeRev
You may be beyond Torei's reach, but you find its strictures having grown on you.  They feel... *right.*  Bowing to the security officer you thrust out your hips, demonstrating your femininity and submission for all to see.  When you raise your masked head you find him blushing fiercely, looking away, but you hardly need his acceptance-- that you had submitted would need to be enough.

Stepping away, your high heeled boots snap upon the tiled floor with each step.

[[Good girl.->SlaveEscapeEnd]]


:: SmugSpecial5
The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe's various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you've used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Anastasia already has one of the Wardrobes open, its cramped interior waiting expectantly for you to enter.

"Well?"  She asks, from her position alongside the control panel.  "Get in.  I want you in that cage before the Ministry shift change."

[["...alright."->SmugSpecial6]]
[["Yes ma'am..."->SmugSpecial6]]


:: SmugSpecial6
With a last hesitant look towards the attendent, you step into the makeshift Wardrobe-- and it responds as you had perhaps expected, with a plethora of arms.  Seizing hold of you they begin the systematic removal of your current oufit, but abstain from the (perhaps expensive) solvents used by other machines.  Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.

Above you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one covering your head but leaving holes at eyes, nose, and mouth-- and being utterly transparent.  Atop it a second layer, this one white, is added to your head and torso.  At your hips it runs down between your legs, adding a second zipper over your womanhood, but the cut is flared so as to expose more of your hips.  Then your arms are forced to cross beneath your chest, heavy laminate bands securing them there-- and forming a straitjacket that would make you utterly helpless.  

Accessories follow in the form of black ballet boots, ensuring you could hardly walk much less run, a hobble chain between your ankles as if to further that proposition, and a thick black collar at your throat.  Only as an afterthought does it seem to add a pair of laminate pieces to your dual-layered hood, one sliding a laminate ring behind your teeth, forcing your mouth into an 'O', before covering your lips, the second clearly intended to serve as a blindfold-- although this hangs loosely to the side of your head for the time being.

Most of the arms retreat afterward, but one remains to stencil a final pair of labels upon your straitjacket: above your left breast the cryptic **#R55**, and on your back in especially bold letters: 

**Slave Detainee**
**Ministry of Truants**

[[And with that, you are released...->SmugSpecial7]]


:: SmugSpecial7
<img src="img/qS3FRyD.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

Anastasia waits without as you emerge, taking careful, measured steps upon your new heels as the hobble limits your range severely.  With your arms bound you're incapable of fending her off as she approaches sharply, a hand upon your shoulder guiding you in a short half-circle turn.

"Very good, very good, the facsimile appears quite successful... excepting two more accesories."  Her own boot slides between yours, tapping lightly on the interior of your left foot.

"Bend over, now.  Legs spread, as far as the hobble will allow."

[["MMmmgh?"->SmugSpecial8A]]
[[Look to her, confused.->SmugSpecial8A]]
[[Bend over, spread your legs.->SmugSpecial8]]


:: SmugSpecial8A
Anastasia sighs.  "Did you think this would merely require dressing the part?  The Truant Officers certainly won't go easy on you, they will think you a slave."

She takes advantage of your bondage to prove her point, seizing you from behind with one arm around your waist before she kicks out your legs-- forcing them as far apart as the hobble would allow.  She follows that with a hand at the back of your collared throat, pushing you down, bending you over.

"Was that so hard?"

[["Mmmmh..."->SmugSpecial8]]
[[Endure quietly.->SmugSpecial8]]


:: SmugSpecial8
Having taken the commanded position, Anastasia gives an approving nod, stepping up behind you.  "Good girl.  Now... let's open you up and get these installed."

Just what that meant is revealed by the sensation of her hand between your legs, nimble fingers landing upon the zipper of your leotard-like straitjacket.  Pulling it open she repeats the process with your catsuit, revealing your womanhood.  Defenseless and exposed, there is little you can do in self-defense as she slides a pair of thin laminate devices into your holes, front and rear.  Afterward she zips you back up, but a pair of tubes now hang between your legs, each ending in a small laminate ball.

You're hardly given a chance to acclimate to the sense of being filled before Anastasia reaches between your legs again, pumping one of the balls several times.  Within your cunt you feel the narrow dildo there begin to expand, inflating with each squeeze of the smuggler's palm.

[["Mmmmmghhh!"->SmugSpecial9]]
[["Mmmmgh..."->SmugSpecial9]]


:: SmugSpecial9
"Oh, you like that, don't you?"  Anastasia laughs, withdrawing her hand.  "Of course you do."

Crossing the room, she approaches an empty space of wall, then presses her hand against one of the bricks there-- revealing a hidden door that unfolds itself, a tunnel leading into darkness.  Stepping in, Anastasia again doesn't look back.

"Come on now, R55."

[[It's not like you have a choice.->SmugSpecial10]]


:: SmugSpecial10
The smuggler's door closes behind you, momentarily casting the tunnel into darkness-- until your eyes adjust to the gloom, revealing small lights set into the floor.  Anastasia is already walking ahead and you struggle to catch up, wary of tripping in your heels without arms to catch yourself.

Passing one door, and then another, she eventually comes to a stop at the third on your left-- although you see one more further up, to the right.  What lay beyond *that* portal you'll never know, as Anastasia instead opens the one before you.

A Truant Officer nearly jumps out of her uniform in response to your sudden entrance, but calms upon seeing Anastasia-- only to startle again when her eyes land upon you.

"You didn't even warn me!"  She complains, a hand at her chest.  Anastasia is unimpressed.

"This proved to be a quickly developing opportunity.  Now-- open the cage for me, will you Valroux?"

The cage in question is just behind her, rather large and all but empty, except for a familiar looking woman in white laminate...

<img src="img/61HlMB3.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

[[Your uniforms are identical.->SmugSpecial11]]


:: SmugSpecial11
The other slave turns to regard the newcomers, her eyes widening as they settle upon Anastasia-- and then even further as they find you.

"Hello again, Sister," Anastasia greets, your inability to speak preventing any attempt at clarifying just what *that* meant.  Either way, the actual switch is thus easily accomplished-- the mystery slave is led out on a leash, clearly trying to speak through her gag, while you are in turn led into the cage, where Officer Valroux locks it behind you.

Anastasia is already making for her tunnel, slave in tow, without even biding you goodbye.  Valroux watches her go, waiting for the tunnel entrance to seal-- blending in with the wall in the same manner you had observed earlier-- before turning to you.

"Look-- I don't know who you are, and I don't really care.  Detainees are inspected at dawn and dusk, each day.  Feedings at noon.  Don't screw this up-- just keep quiet, be the submissive slave everyone expects you to be.  Got it?"

[[It's not like you can respond.->SmugSpecial12]]


:: SmugSpecial12 [End-Count]
Time passes slowly in your cage.  You stand, you kneel, you pace-- until the morning inspection comes.  Two Officers enter, one directing you to face the cage, while the other runs her hands down your suit.  They check your locks, your buckles, your straitjacket, and most annoyingly your inflatable plugs.  Several squeezes later, the phallic intruders bulging within you, they withdraw-- but not before securing your blindfold in place across your eyes.

"Gotta watch Valroux," one Officer tells the other, as they retreat.  "She's getting soft.  Protocol demands R55 be kept gagged and blindfolded, unless being transported-- so make sure it gets done with every inspection."

The other Officer doesn't reply, perhaps nodding although your blindfold denies you that fact.  With a final squeeze of your inflatable they retreat, leaving you to your cage.

Without eyes to see, you have only the schedule Valroux had given you to guess at the time.  Occasionally guards can be heard changing shifts in the room beyond your cell, but your hood leaves them slightly muffled, details are hard to make out.  When you hear footsteps directly outside the bars, however, you know *something* is up.

"On your knees, slave," what must be an Officer commands.  "Hurry up, if you want to get fed."

*Food!*  You cannot remember the last time you ate, sometime before waking up tied to that bed you imagine.

Her tone remains even, collected.  "Show me your ID."

You do, and there she finds SLAVE stamped all so clearly upon it.  "A poor first impression," she notes, returning it to you.  "A slave with a false tongue.  But I will not have you removed, not if you demonstrate you understand your place."

The toe of her heeled shoe taps the ground beside her, *click-click*.

"On your knees."](if: $Slave is true)[I very much doubt that, slave.  Even if the laws regarding such a uniform were not clear, the way you wear it would speak to your purpose.  The subtle shifting of your hips, the way you walk-- you're wet, aroused from the simple act of being so restrained.  A faceless little thing for the pleasure of your betters, I suspect."

Her tone remains even, collected.  "Show me your ID."

You do, and there she finds FREEWOMB stamped all so clearly upon it.  "Interesting-- how did you end up in such a state?  Curiosity abounds.  Yet decorum remains, and you are under the Slave Codes.  I will not have you removed, not if you demonstrate you understand your place."

The toe of her heeled shoe taps the ground beside her, *click-click*.

[[You will not take this-- leave!->CustomHub]]
[[You move to your knees, a proper slave.->AcadGreetKneel]]

You take the offered seat, seated beside her on the lip of the pool.  Within her hand still distrubs the water, ripples spreading in all directions.

"What brings you to me, at this hour?"

:: SmugFood1
Hunger drives you from your siting position to your knees, blindness and straitjacket making it a bit of an effort.  Still, you must manage a pleasing response as you hear the cell door open.  The Officer approaches, unhooking your gag panel and then pulling it out, allowing it to hand from the side of your head.  Your ring gag remains however, drool now free to drip lewdly down upon your chest.

"Alright," the Officer continues.  "You have two minutes."

[[Just what did that mean?->SmugFood2]]


:: SmugFoodFail
Your refusal is met with a sigh from the Officer, but she does proceed to replace your panel gag-- once more rendering your head into an unbroken shell of white laminate.

"Fine, be that way."  She growls.  "You'll have to eat eventually."

Had the other prisoner not been eating?  If so, you had maintained what little dignity you could in this situation, but it does leave you feeling distinctly hungry-- the pang in your stomach only growing as the Officer stalks away, closing your cage afterward.

[[You're alone again.->SmugWalk]]


:: SmugFood2
A hand settles on your laminate hooded head, followed by something at your lips-- passing quickly into your mouth, slotting perfectly within the ring you cannot dislodge.  Deeper and deeper it goes, filling your mouth as it then threatens your throat, serious effort required to keep from gagging on the laminate dildo.

Your confusion seems to be interpreted by the Officer as hesitation, resulting in a sigh.  "Well come on now, suck it down, slut.  90 seconds left, I'm watching the clock."

*Suck it down?*

[[You're not doing anything like that!->SmugFoodFail2]]
[[Try sucking on the cock.->SmugFood3]]


:: SmugFoodFail2
Your refusal is met with a sigh from the Officer, but she does slide the cock out from between your lips.  Wiping the excess spit hanging from it on your cheek, she proceeds to replace your panel gag-- once more rendering your head into an unbroken shell of white laminate.

"Fine, be that way."  She growls.  "You'll have to eat eventually."

Had the other prisoner not been eating?  If so, you had maintained what little dignity you could in this situation, but it does leave you feeling distinctly hungry-- the pang in your stomach only growing as the Officer stalks away, closing your cage afterward.

[[You're alone again.->SmugWalk]]


:: SmugFood3
Unable to close your lips, your mouth and throat does much of the work, experimenting carefully with a suckling the phallic object rammed down your throat-- and immediately you're rewarded with the member discharging, most of it dumping straight down your throat but some lands on the back of your tongue.  It tastes... rather horrid, but already your stomach seems to be responding, begging for the nutrients.

"One minute of slave slurry left," counts the Officer.

[[Food!  Suck hard!->SmugFoodHard]]
[[Suck, but carefully.->SmugFoodMed]]
[[Absolutely not!  Pull back!->SmugFoodFail2]]


:: SmugFoodHard
You choose a frantic pace, sucking greedily on the offered cock, even moving your head back and forth to further the effort.  The phallic imposter responds in kind, warm streams of slurry erupting from its tip to run down your throat.  In the end you manage to fill yourself quite contentedly, and are going for even more when the dildo is suddenly slid back out from your lips.  Your efforts had caused some of the slurry to build up, and now it runs down your chin, joining the drool on your chest in a truly wanton display of lust.

"Thank gods you started eating," the Officer notes, sounding quite surprised, "but you sure were eager for a little cock, huh?"

Your tongue emerges from the ring gag, having worked up a panting sweat.  Had the mystery prisoner been refusing to eat?  You've certainly set a different, far less dignified tone.  Not that you're given the opportunity to ask as the panel covering your lips is suddenly pulled tight, then locked in place.  The Officer leaves you there, drool and slurry on your chest, but at least quite full.

[[Worth it.->SmugWalk]]


:: SmugFoodMed
You choose a measured pace, sucking shamefully on the cock thrust into your mouth, but maintaining as much dignity as you could muster in such a situation.  It allows you to suck down enough of the slave food to satiate yourself, but only barely-- hunger pangs still rumbling your stomach as the intruder is slid suddenly from your mouth.

"You actually ate," the Officer comments, surrounding both surprised and pleased.  "*Finally*."

Had the mysterious prisoner you've replaced been refusing?  You're not given the opportunity to ask as the panel covering your lips is suddenly pulled tight, then locked in place.  The Officer leaves you there, drool on your chest, but at least a bit less hungry now.

[[Worth it.->SmugWalk]]


:: SmugWalk
You know the pattern now, and soon fall into a monotonous grind of working through the paces.  Inspections at dawn and dusk, your feedings at noon.  Otherwise the Officers leave you alone in the darkness of your blindfold, except to occasionally squeeze your plugs.  Only Valroux occasionally allows you to go without your blindfold, but those periods allow you little more then a vista of steel bars and brick walls.

Days pass, one by one, until *finally* the schedule is broken.  They come for you in the morning, just after your first inspection.

"Get her up," an Officer commands, booted feet approaching to lift you.  Once there the blindfold is removed, hanging from your mask against your cheek as you gaze at three Officers-- one to each side, the other standing before you.

"I still have no idea why you were trying to cross the border the way you did, and if I could I'd send you to a tight little cell at the Ministry-- but the treaties with the Offworlders require we return you.  So we will."

She snaps a leash to your collar, then tugs it harshly.  "Follow."

[[You don't have a choice.->SmugWalk2]]


:: SmugWalk2
The Officers still flank you to each side as you're marched from the cage you've spent the last several days in.  Still in your ballet boots, still hobbled, you need to be careful on the stairs, but you manage as best you can.

Exiting what must be the local Truant Officer's barracks, you emerge back into the Aekoran Customs Enclave-- your escort and uniform immediately drawing stairs.  In fact your forced march becomes something of an event, so many tourists being treated to their first *true* Torean experience as you make your way to the checkpoint.

If at once time you would have been denied passage, now you're allowed through with nary a hesitation, Anastasia's tale of your being returned to the international zone clearly coming true.  Waiting for you on the far side are a set of international zone security officers, their lack of laminate and mostly male genders marking them as decidedly non-Torean.

Seeing your uniform, their leader sighs.  "Is all that really necessary?"

"She *deserves* a collar," the Truant Officer snaps back.  "Just because we can't prove it doesn't mean we weren't going to make sure she knew her place, while back in Torei."

As if to demonstrate the point, she yanks down on your leash-- hard.  "Show them how much of a stupid, submissive slut you are."

[[Show them.  Kneel and spread your legs.->SmugWalkSub]]
[[You're no longer in Torei.  Deny her.->SmugWalkNo]]


:: SmugWalkSub
Your role may be as an imposter, but the Officer has you right: you *are* a properly submissive slut.  Sinking to your knees before the men, you spread your legs, revealing more prominently to them the inflators of your plugs dangling there.

"See?"  The Truant Officer says, gleeful to make one last point before she hands your leash to their lead man.  "She would be happier here in tight bondage then with *you.*"

The Security Officer sighs.  "Be that as it may... let's get that hood off her, at the very least."  You're on free soil, but still the prospect is alarming-- your ruse becoming clear as soon as the tight laminate is peeled from your face.  The commotion is immediate, the Truant Officers demanding to know who you are just as aggressively as the Security Officers.  Decorum eventually reasserts itself with the Security Officer pointing out that no matter *who* you are, you're on the international side of the border.  And that meant you're free.

[[Look back at the Truant Officer.  "Who's stupid now?"->SmugWalkStupid]]
[[Remain demurely at the side of the man holding your leash.->SmugWalkQ]]


:: SmugWalkNo
Your role may be as an imposter, but the Officer has you wrong: she has no power over you anymore, and you demonstrate that by yanking your own neck up-- wrenching your leash free from her grip.

"*Bad* mistake, who--" the Truant Officer begins, only for the Security Officer to intervene with a chuckle.

"Not so  fast, she's my jurisdiction now.  Let's get that hood of her, poor girl."  You're on free soil, but still the prospect is alarming-- your ruse becoming clear as soon as the tight laminate is peeled from your face.  The commotion is immediate, the Truant Officers demanding to know who you are just as aggressively as the Security Officers.  Decorum eventually reasserts itself with the Security Officer pointing out that no matter *who* you are, you're on the international side of the border.  And treaty laws meant you're free.

[[Look back at the Truant Officer.  "Who's stupid now?"->SmugWalkStupid]]
[[Remain demurely quiet as they hash it out.->SmugWalkQ]]


:: SmugWalkStupid
"Why you--"  How often did a Torean woman, freewomb or slave, speak that way to an Officer of *her* rank?  Her subordinates step in to hold her back, and for once you've got the last laugh as the international zone Security Officers lead you away for debriefing.

There are more men in the room you're eventually led to then you've seen all day, and between them they explain your situation.  In short?  You're free.  Already the Ministry of Truants is arguing for your re-extradition, but the international zone is careful to protect its own rights, and here that helps you immensely.  Everything else bleeds into the backround as you wrestle with that, though: you're *free*.  You've made it!  Despite everything Torei has thrown at you, from the hotel to the streets to the club, you've come out on the other side-- encased in glossy laminate, but *free.*

"Excuse me, Miss," one of the men intercedes, concern on his face.  "You're free to go, but we do have some clothes here we can offer you.  Instead of... *that.*"

He meant your detainee suit, of course.

[["Thank you, I would appreciate that."->DetEscapeClothes]]
[["Actually... no, I'll keep my suit.  Just undo my arms?"->DetEscapeSuit]]


:: SmugWalkQ
"Fine, fine," the Truant Officer finally breaks from her arguing, ceding their point of jurisdiction.  "But just look at her-- she'll be back, someday.  And she'll probably *want* a collar by then."

You gave her the last word as the Security Officers lead you away for debriefing, and she had in turn left you with something to wrestle with: did you *really* want to leave?  It's too late to turn back for now, anyway.

The outfit they eventually provide is not particularly flashy, but it is about as far from your laminate uniform as could be managed.  Freed from so much glossy material, you return to a state of dignity, the Officers leading you out and releasing you with a complimentary new ticket for the Way Up.

You're no longer lost in laminate.

[[And the Way Up looms...->SmugRunEnd]]


:: DetEscapeSuit
Your answer seems to stun the collected security Officers, standing as they are in a circle around you.  Several are very clearly trying to not stare at your laminated form, so tightly sealed, hooded and restrained.  Yet they hardly seem ready to argue the point either, your liberty here at least still very much maintained-- even if you chose not to seek *dignity.*

Freeing your arms, you're ventually lead out to the international concourse, where the final Officer gestures that you're truly free to go-- and the Way Up looms above.
(set: $GEndOutfit to 1)
[[Be on your way...->SmugRunEnd]]
[[Give him a parting reverence.  "Thank you, sir."->DetEscapeRev]]


:: SmugRunEnd
Despite having awoken tied to your own rented bed, without a credit to your name, you've made it.  You're free, beyond the grasping shackles of Torean society, it's strange culture and restraints.  (if: $GEndOutfit is 1)[(Even if you've retained the uniform.)  ]Perhaps several days locked inside a cage, plugged and teased, fed only the sucking of a cock was hardly an escape worth celebrating... but you've escaped Torei, a fate few others could claim.

[[You make your way towards the space elevator.->GoodEnding]]


:: DetEscapeRev
You may be beyond Torei's reach, but you find its strictures having grown on you.  They feel... *right.*  Bowing to the security officer you thrust out your hips, demonstrating your femininity and submission for all to see.  When you raise your masked head you find him blushing fiercely, looking away, but you hardly need his acceptance-- that you had submitted would need to be enough.

Stepping away, your ballet boots snap upon the tiled floor with each step.

[[Good girl.->SmugRunEnd]]


:: AcadGreet3
(if: $Servant is true or $Slave is true)[She looks down at your kneeling form.](else:)[She looks to you, seated beside her.]  "Well, let me formally welcome you to the only off-campus refuge provided by Celeste Academy, the largest training academy in Aekroa."

She pulls her hand from the water, flicking her fingers to dry her red-gloved hand before collecting both hands upon her lap.  "We are strategically positioned here, and staffed all night for a very particular reason-- to provide an *alternative.*"

[["An alternative to what?"->AcadGreet4]]
[["I'm not sure I understand...?"->AcadGreet4]]


:: AcadGreet4
The woman returns her gaze to yours.  "As the only means of exiting Aekora into the international zone, where slavery does not exist, it is not uncommon to see those passing through who are... running out of options," she explains.  "Freewombs nearing a collar, slaves on the run, tourists in fear of Ministry-- all sorts make it this far, only to see that final checkpoint, all those Truant Officers.  A wall they cannot cross, not without *considerable* risk."

She smiles.  "Celeste Acadamy is the alternative.  If the chances are high that you're about to be collared, you're already destined to enroll with us-- Celeste Academy holds an exclusive contract with the local branch of the Ministry of Truants.  Convicted prisoners stripped of their freewomb status are given over to us for training, or retraining, as necessary.  But *how* one gets enrolled is important.  Come to us willingly, enroll *yourself*, and you can achieve a better valuation and thus placement during your time with us.  Often that leads to a more comfortable sort of service upon graduation, and auction."

(if: $Servant is true or $Slave is true)[You get the sense she would have greeted you more formally in that moment, had you not been dressed as you are, but she still nods your way.](else:)[She stands, bowing lightly in your direction.]  "My name is Veronica.  Are you interested in discussing enrollment?"

Again Veronica returns her hand to the water, new ripples forming.  "I thought so.  I am here to answer any questions, if you have them."

Between forced slavery and that flickering promise of freedom, something else now stands between: accepting the inevitable.

[[She awaits your questions-- or enrollment.->CustomAcademy]]

Again Veronica returns her hand to the water, new ripples forming.  "I understand.  If you change your mind, I will be here to answer any questions."

Between forced slavery and that flickering promise of freedom, something else now stands between: accepting the inevitable.

[[She awaits your questions-- or enrollment.->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadReally
"You will," Veronica states, matter-of-fact.  "Enrolling with Celeste involves stripping you of prior status, and firmly submitting yourself to a life of slavery.  We cannot guarantee just *what* sort of slave you will eventually become, that depends on the effort you put into your training, but you will graduate at the end to the auction block."

She sounds almost proud.  "Voluntary enrollments generally translate to higher valuation at the end, an important consideration.  Inexpensive slaves, who often come to us from the Ministry of Truants, often end up serving in very... menial roles.  Torei does need a constant supply of servant-slaves and ponygirls, however."

[["Right..."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadServant
"Your ID, again?"  Pulling up your records, Veronica pages through them slowly.  "Hmm... very interesting, that collaring looks *quite* irregular.  And mere hours old.  Well-- our working relationship with the Ministry of Truants proves quite useful in such irregular situations.  Having your current slavery invalidated should be simple enough, as long as you're enrolling with us-- the Courts would be more concerned that you remain in slavery, not the particular terms of it."

[[Well that is... good news?->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadSlave
"Your ID, again?"  Pulling up your records, Veronica pages through them slowly.  "Hmm... no.  Voluntary submission to a slave suit is rare, but it would not harm an attempt to enroll with us.  In fact, it demonstrates a clear indication of submissive tendencies.  That would in fact serve you quite well-- as a fully collared slave you would of course be under constant restrictions, and expectations would be that you respect your betters."

Veronica adjusts her posture slightly.  "As a slave, that is most everyone else."

[["I have other questions."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadCor
Veronica has an immediate answer for that one.  "We do not turn away voluntary enrollees.  She would be welcomed.  You both would be.  Obviously we can not guarantee you would remain together if such a decision was embraced, however."
(set: $CorAcad to true)
An auction implied sale to the highest bidder, after all.  Still-- something to discuss with Corinth, if you desired.

[[I have other questions."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadDeets
"You would be moved to our campus, in the Aekoran countryside.  There, along with the other new students, you would begin your generalized slave lessons.  Those persist for several weeks, during which you would be evaluated for presumptive value and your level of dependence-- a good slave can be very dependent, or independent, but it does change what we will train you in."

She taps the toe of her shoe against the tiled floor, as if to mark the change to a different period of training.  "After that, you will be assigned to a program specialty.  Just how long that will be would vary, depending on what you specialize in.  Some require several months, others *years*."

[["Good... to know."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadTruant
The Academy Spokeswoman tips her head slightly in your direction.  "We have a strong working agreement with the Ministry of Truants-- most anything can be written off if you submit willingly to a collar.  Thus our position here, so near the border.  We remain the alternative to an unfortunate stay with the Ministry, followed by potentially low valuation for auction."

The idea of being worth little seems to horrify the woman.  "A terrible fate."

[["Right."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadTrain
"Celeste Academy is by *far* the largest training academy in this Ringdom, and as such our offered courses of instruction are quite broad.  Servants, concubines, ponygirls, governesses, soubrettes-- I could go on.  Our most expensive offerings are slaves trained to serve as picture-perfect wives to our more wealthy clients, and of course our Torean-famous dolls."

[["Wife?  Like... in marriage?"->AcadWife]]
[["What do you mean by 'doll'?"->AcadDoll]]
[["I have other questions."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadEnroll
For all her demonstrated reserve, your words now do provoke Veronica's attention to pull from the water she sat beside-- landing on you fully, as if capable of seizing you bodily.

"This is not a decision to be taken lightly," she asserts, the glossy laminate of her outfit running with waves of reflected light as she leans towards you, emphasizing the point.  "There is no going back, upon enrollment.  To sign upon the proverbial line is final, you would be collared tonight-- and your transporation to our campus arranged on the morrow.  So you must be **sure** this is what you desire."

(if: $CorSlave is true and $CorStat is 5)[*Enrolling now without helping Corinth decide upon what she is to do would leave her behind.*]

[["Let me... think about it."->CustomAcademy]]
[["I'm sure-- I want this."->AcadEnroll2]]


:: AcadWife
"What else could I mean?" Veronica asks, eyes narrowing as if to question the very pertinence of your question.  "Celeste Academy offers a catalogue of available slaves trained for full spousal duties: cooking, cleaning, sexual performance.  The full feminine suite.  Offworlders especially seem to favor them."


[["What about the 'dolls' you mentioned?"->AcadDoll]]
[["I have other questions."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadDoll
"The ultimate sexual toy," Veronica smiles.  "Trained in the full suite of sexual activities and service, *intensely* submissive, and delivered to the buyer sealed in a pretty pink box.  If our wives are the epitome of the independence we seek in slaves, our dolls are by far the most dependent-- and expensive."

[["Wife?  Like... in marriage?"->AcadWife]]
[["I have other questions."->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadEnroll2
Veronica retains her stare.  "Why?"

The question floats between you, all but bursting with expectation.  Why indeed did you wish to give yourself so freely to a lifetime of slavery?

[["Actually... you're right, nevermind."->CustomAcademy]]
[["I don't know, I just want to."->AcadEnrollFail]]
[["I feel... most comfortable, on my knees."->AcadEnrollPass]]
[["I just never want to leave Torei."->AcadEnrollFail2]]
[["This is my only chance to make something good of today."->AcadEnrollPass]]
[["I'm... ready to admit that I need a collar."->AcadEnrollPass]]


:: AcadEnrollFail
"Not good enough," the spokeswoman replies immediately, breaking the gaze she had held upon you so completely.  "Consider more completely why you seek a collar."

[[You can't even enslave yourself right!->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadEnrollPass
Veronica holds your gaze for a long time, looking into your eyes, perhaps determining if you measured up.  Her conclusion, when it comes, arrives suddenly-- she stands.  A small desk is situated in the corner of the otherwise desolate room, and it is from that edifice that she retrieves a glassboard.

"By signing this provisional contract, you will be waiving all personal rights and responsibilities to Celeste Academy, pursuant to its foundational charter.  This is effectively the same as being collared immediately, but we leave it open to provide for revisions that more closely suit your position going forward once we assign you a final role and begin training for that."

She's reading of the glassboard, but turns it around to you now, a litany of text running in stark neon down the front-- until it ends with a singular line intended for a signature.  Signing away one's liberty was a simple enough thing, on Torei.

Offering it to you, she then pulls forth a simple circle of silver, unadorned but clearly featuring a heavy lock on the back.  A collar.  *Your* collar.  Even looking over the contract you can see it there, a gleaming promise in Veronica's hands as she asks perhaps the most important question of your life.

"Do you submit?"

[[...no!  You can't do it!->AcadEnrollBack]]
[["...yes."  Sign the board.->AcadEnrollPass2]]


:: AcadEnrollFail2
"There are many ways to stay upon this planet, and many of them do not involve a collar."  It's a testament to Torei's culture that she did not say *most* reasons did not involve collars.  "Consider why you seek to enroll more fully, and if you wish to discuss this again we can."

[[Rejected.->CustomAcademy]]


:: AcadEnrollBack
Veronica accepts the glassboard back, her lips set in a firm line, but her eyes surprisingly sympathetic.  "It is a momentous step.  Many cannot bring themselves to cross that final line, to place their name upon the dotted line.  I understand."

The collar disappears behind the board, as she holds it to your chest.  "The door here remains open if you change your mind, however."

[[Hurriedly you escape the Academy's refuge.->CustomHub]]


:: AcadEnrollPass2
With perhaps a slight tremble in your hand you take up the lightpen connected to the board, and with a few simple strokes sign away your rights and liberties-- letter by letter.

When it is done Veronica accepts the glassboard back, affixing her own signature as principle witness.  Then she looks to you, a far more domineering tone in her voice.

"Come closer... and kneel"

[[Her tone brooks no argument.  You approach, and kneel.->AcadEnrollPass3]]


:: AcadEnrollPass3
Above you, the Academy recruiter holds the collar aloft-- as if to recognize the importance of this act-- before she lowers it.  (if: $Servant is true)[Aligning it with your throat, just below the collar you had received at Club Lush,](else:)[Aligning it with your throat,] she closes it slowly, the interior band pulling tighter as she does, cinching so as to provide as tight an embrace as possible. When her hands withdraw it remains, just uncomfortable enough that its presence could never be forgotten.

Veronica smiles from above you.  "Welcome to Celeste Academy."

[[So close to the Way Up, but all but impossible to reach now...->AcadEnrollPass4]]


:: AcadEnrollPass4
Several hours later you lay on the small padded portion of a cell, Veronica having led you to the room located just behind the public area of the Academy's small refuge.  You would be taken to Celeste's campus in the morning, and until then you would be kept here-- just another collared slave locked inside a cage, awaiting a fate she could no longer control.

How had it come to this?  Was that terror, existential and overwhelming, that you felt in your heart-- or a trembling *thrill*?  Reaching up, you slowly run a finger along the silver restraint now locked to your neck, marking you readily as something less then human.  You're... property now, of a sort.  A student to be trained fully in the culture and expectations of this planet, to be shaped and molded into something truly... *Torean.*  A creature of pleasure wrapped into laminate.

Kneeling primly, you glance down, adjusting your newly provided laminate.  Celeste Academy issued Wardrobe rights to this singular uniform to each of its students, as you were informed during orientation.  It's your first day at the Academy, and at the very least your dedicated to making a proper first impression.  The weight of the collar around your neck, a large ring hanging from it to provide for all manner of leashes and restraints, provides extra incentive.  As a slave, you would be punished promptly for stepping out of line.

Thus you fiddle with your skirt, the black pleats providing a bit of coverage that your blouse does not-- it is violet, the Academy's color, but semi-transparent.  Your breasts(if: $Pierced is true)[ and pierced nipples] being on clear display.  The skirt itself is longer then you have come to expect of Torei, but you know why: your uniform lacks panties entirely.  

Just as you finish smoothing out a wrinkle the secretary seated at the desk nearby looks up, checking her *glass* display before turning her gaze to you.  "The Headmistress is ready for you, student."

[["Thank you, ma'am."->AcadIntroGood]]
[["Okay."->AcadIntroBad]]


:: CorShip
"Excellent," Anastasia replies, tapping out a command into her glass.  Then she waits, patiently, until the requisite credits are indeed drained from your account.  Once it does, you're treated to perhaps Anastasia's first pleased expression-- although quickly it turns predatory.  She leans over table, one hand upon it. 

"We will begin prepping you both for shipment immediately.  All you *need* to do is tell the woman at the counter you want 'the slave's special.'"

Turning your head, you look across the small cafe to where the cafe's attendent is slowly cleaning out a teacup.  She looks bored.

[["Okay, I can do that."->CorShip4]]
[["That's it?"->CorShip4]]


:: CorShip4
Anastasia nods, then leans back with her teacup, pointedly dismissing both you and Corinth with her sudden disinterest.  Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

"Oh... I did not like her," your friend attempts to whisper, although her regulation mask makes that difficult.  She lapses back into silence as you step up to the counter.

"What will it be, ma'am?"  The attendant asks.

[["The... slave's special?"->CorShip5]]


:: CorShip5
The attendent perks up at that, looking over your shoulder to where Anastasia remains seated.  To the unasked question the 'travel agent' nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

"Well then," she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  "Follow me."

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.  As you hesistate Corinth steps forward, the black glossy of her laminate rear the last thing you see before she too disappears.

[[You're committed now.  Follow her!->CorShip6]]


:: CorShip6
The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe's various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you've used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Picking up a glassboard hanging from the side of the wardrobe, the attendant flicks through several pages.  "Hmmm... ah, you girls are lucky indeed.  Next scheduled pickup is for a pair of fully Academy trained and certified fuckdoll slaves.  That means... the violet outfit..."

She taps upon the Wardrobe's control panel.  "...boots... makeup... gag... there!"

Turning to you, she uses the glassboard to gesture towards the maw of the waiting Wardrobe.  "Well?  In ya go."

[["Wait-- what kind of slave?"->CorShip7Ex]]
[["I'm not going in there!"->CorShip7Resist]]
[["Right... okay."->CorShip7]]


:: CorShip7Ex
"Hmm?  Oh!"  The attendent looks to you, then raps the nearest crate with the back of her hand.  "We use different boxes, different claims of what sort of slaves are being shipped-- anything to throw off the Ministry.  You're going in as an Academy fuckdoll, a slave who has been trained as a very dutiful sort of concubine.  But that's just your cover, of course!  All you need to do is look the part."

She repeats the gesture towards the Wardrobe.  "So... in ya go!"

[["I'm not going in there!"->CorShip7Resist]]
[["Right... okay."->CorShip7]]


:: CorShip7Resist
The attendent frowns a bit.  "It's... a bit late for that.  Usually the people who do this *need* to leave, don't you?  To get into the international zone?  Well this is the way it's going to happen.  So... get in there."

Corinth is already approaching her own Wardrobe.  "Come on," she indicates the machine next to her.  "We can *totally* do this."

[["Wait-- what kind of slave?"->CorShip7Ex]]
[["Right... okay."->CorShip7]]


:: CorShip7
With a last hesitant look towards Corinth, you both step into the makeship Wardrobes at the same time-- and your machine responds as you had perhaps expected, with a plethora of arms.  Seizing hold of you they begin the systematic removal of your current oufit, but abstain from the (perhaps expensive) solvents used by other machines.  Instead your laminate is simply cut off, the sensation of sharp shears running so near your skin quite disconcerting.  Yet it achieves its goal without cutting you, leaving you momentarily stripped to your bare skin.

Above you the halo-like device that mounted the printing armatures descends, and your new gear is built in place upon you.  It starts with a Torean classic, the catsuit, this one in a purple shade that quickly proves to be semi-transparent.  Black is then chosen for your accessories, which are formed more slowly.  At your feet ballet heels are extruded and then connected to knee high boots, while at your waist an underbust corset is installed, then tightened cruelly by the Wardrobe itself.  

Afterward your arms are pulled back and layers of laminate applied upon them, linking them together in a single-sleeve armbinder that both prevents any usage of your arms *and* proves decidedly uncomfortable in mere moments.  Progressing further up a posture collar, also in black, is printed for around your throat.  With it in place, running firmly from jaw to collarbone, you cannot turn your head nor look down.  Makeup follows, violet lipstick being applied to your lips, eyeliner and blush accompanying-- while large fake eyelashes ensure a permanently sultry look.

The final component is a gag, a large black ball being seated behind your teeth as straps are printed to hold it firmly in place by snapping into place behind your head.  Annoyingly, a tube seems to emerge from the back of the ball, tickling your throat slightly.  Only then does the Wardrobe release you back out into the backroom.

[[You emerge...->CorShip8]]


:: CorShip8
You step out of the Wardrobe Device (if: $Ballet is true)[in a display of dexterity, having grown accustomed to ballet heels](else:)[stumbling and nearly falling over given your shoes.]  Intended to keep you permantently *en pointe*, they're already competing with the strict pull of your new armbinder for the title of 'most uncomfortable.'

Yet if you're fighting your new outfit, at your side Corinth emerges, her inexperience leading to a far greater degree of trouble.  Her uniform is an exact copy of your own, semi-transparent violet catsuit, corset and heels in black, down to the blonde hair that now runs down to her shoulders-- her own auburn locks having apparently been dyed.

Noticing your emergence, the attendant looks to you with a smile, standing over a pair of long crates now laying upon the floor, the pink foam within holding a distinctly feminine silhouette.

"Look at you two," she muses, as Corinth wriggles impotently beside you.  "A matching set of feminine little dolls now, hm?"

(link-reveal: "No I'm not!")[[[  "Mmmmmgh!"->CorShip9]]]
(link-reveal: "I have to wear all this?!")[[[  "Mmhhmmgh!"->CorShip9]]]
(link-reveal: "Corinth!?")[[[  "Mhhmgh?"->CorShip9]]]


:: CorShip9
"Well, the gag clearly works," the attendant laughs.  Brushing a bit of your own hair from your eyes, she glides her hands up the violet laminate of your chest.  It's a simple tease, and one she doesn't linger on before turning to present you to the box upon the floor.

"Now, be good dolls and move up beside your boxes.  Printed the foam inserts to your exact measurements, while you were inside the Wardrobe.  Should be nice and comfy... for awhile, at least."

[["Mmmmggh?"->CorShip10a]]
[["Mmmmgh..."->CorShip10a]]
[[Let her guide you to the box.->CorShip10]]


:: CorShip10a
"I *really* can't understand you with that gag in," the attendent notes.  "You really should practice your gag talk."

*Was that a thing?*

[[Let her guide you to the box.->CorShip10]]


:: CorShip10
Given your bondage it takes a good bit of effort and assistance from the attendant, but eventually you lead the way for Corinth, and soon find yourself laying in the box just tall enough to fit you.  The foam padding beneath you is indeed rather comfortable, even providing a perfectly shaped indent for your bound arms.  What's decidedly less comfortable is the lead she connects to the front of your ballgag, the tube positioned down your throat now serving a clear purpose, as she loads a small jug of some sort of liquid into the box beside your head.  Food.

Further restraints follow, black straps anchored in the box emerging to snap tightly across your body at ankle, hips, waist, and throat-- all of which Corinth watches wide-eyed, her hips shimmying back and forth.  Was this whole predicament... turning her on?

"There--" the attendent concludes, placing two more items in the insets apparently designed just for them.  "Accessories... extra gag, and a vibrating wand.  Done!  One counterfeit Academy-grade fuckdoll, all pretty and packed up.  You just need your lid, and you're lucky, dolls get a *view.*"

<img src="img/LHncakj.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

To demonstrate she holds up the lid for your box, which indeed does have a clear panel that would expose you from waist to head.  The pink graphics and label mark the contents as *Fuckdoll Slave*, *A Fully Trained Torean Doll*, and *A Product of Celeste Academy*.

Unable to move, there is little you can do as the lid slotted into place upon your box, then secured with several heavy locks.  Corinth is led to her own box moments later, disappearing from view, although you can see the attendent eventually sliding her lid firmly down.

[["Mmmgh..."->CorShip11]]


:: CorShip11
Through the window of your crate, the attendant waves with a smile.  "Package pickup is the morning, but you're all set for..." she has the glassboard again, consulting it.  "Ah, tough luck.  Longer route.  Well-- enjoy your time as dolls, girls, you're looking at perhaps two weeks of it."

Tapping your crate, she turns back to return to the cafe's front.

[["Mmmmmghh!"->CorShip12]]
[[Remain silent.  It's no use."->CorShip12]]


:: CorShip12
Somewhere to your side Corinth moans lewdly, but it achieves little.

As promised, they come for you in the morning-- two men, wearing simple laminate overalls.  They very much look the part of basic labor and act like it, working together to lift your box.  The restraints and foam work cooperatively to limit your jostling, and if your toes weren't so strictly pointed and your arms not bent back it would have almost been comfortable.

Instead of taking you back through the cafe they carry your display box through some manner of backend tunnel before eventually spilling out onto a public thoroughfare, where a flatbed truck awaits.  There you're loaded alongside a variety of other packages and crates, little more then property being moved from one place to another.  Placed on your back looking up towards the sky, you're given your first (at least that you could recall) view of the Way Up stretching towards the heavens through the window of your box.  You're *so* close, and yet in laminate and restraints, boxed like a perfect little doll, you might as well be a thousand miles away.  

Corinth's box is retrieved afterward, her quiet moans audible as the men eventually set her down on the higher stack of boxes, tilted sideways to fit-- and allowing you to momentarily meet your fellow faux-doll's eyes.

[[One of the porters appears above you.->CorShip13]]


:: CorShip13
"You know the worst part, Arnst?" He asks to his partner, presumably driving the truck up front.  "When they make us haul one of these girls who are worth more then we make in a *year*, you know?"

The other man, presumably Arnst, seems to suggest a shrug by tone alone.  "Don't kick yourself about it, everyone knows those Academy fuck dolls are overpriced."

The man above you meets your eyes through the clear portion of your box.  "I don't know, I heard they're pretty well trained."

You may have been staring at him, but he seems content to treat you as almost inanimate. 

[[Moan lewdly, arch your back.->CorShip14A]]
[[Remain silent.->CorShip14B]]


:: CorShip14A
Playing to the role assigned, you act the doll, moaning into your gag as you arch your back.  Your bondage prevents much movement, but your chest is thrust up a bit for his pleasure.  Corinth follows your lead, pulling against her bondage to do much the same.  The man catches the sound and movement, a hand coming to his chin, as if in thought.

"Slutty little things..."

Arnst, up front, calls again.  "You better stop fantasizing about owning those girls, and get back to work.  Certainly you won't see them again, did you see that manifest?  They're going far out into the Antipodes."

The man above you sighs.  "I bet she'd be a fun time..."

[[He disappears from view, and you're left to your thoughts.->CorShip15]]

:: CorShip15
Time passes dreadfully slowly, in your box.  Corinth, without even a view of the sky to pass her time, appears to lapse into a blank-eyed submissive state.  Eventually you both are offloaded from the truck, entering a processing center of some sort.  You catch the glimpse of the occasional collared slave peeking into your display box, but most simply seem focused on their work-- and soon you're being loaded into the baggage compartment of a train.  That's even worse, the barest hint of interesting locales replaced by a darkened interior.  That Corinth remains nearby is only evidenced by the wet little moan she gives upon her box being placed nearby.

Sometime later, you think its night, you finally work up the courage to suckle on the tube hanging from your gag-- and are rewarded with a foul slurry that runs down your throat.  Apparently the food of slaves, but all you can attest to is that it's thankfully filling.  You don't need to eat much.

And thus a cycle developes, your drifting into fitful sleep only to be awakened by the rattle of the train.  When hungry you suck out some more of the nutriant slurry.

[[Slowly the hours become days... a week passes.->CorShip16]]


:: CorShip16
The train slows... but are you caught in a dream?  It's been getting hard to tell the difference between the waking reality of your dark compartment and your sleep that seems filled with much the same.  That you're awake becomes clear as you feel the ache in your arms and legs, a telltale sign soon replaced by blinding *light.*

"Transit number... yeah, there they are," a female voice declares, just before hands settle upon your box.  You're pulled out into the blinding light of day, although thankfully you're propped up against the side of the train instead of staring up directly into that burning sun.  Corinth's box follows, her brows upturning slightly as she is carried past before being leaned up beside you.

You're on a train platform of some sort, rolling fields of green stretching out across the horizon.  Before you stands something downright terrifying, however-- a pair of Truant Officers.

*Has the plan come apart?  You can't even run!*

[[They begin unlocking both your display boxes.->CorShip17]]


:: CorShip17
<img src="img/iQB9t2X.jpg" width="30%" height="30%">

"Be careful," the Officer working upon Corinth's box admonishes the one working on yours, adjusting her cap.  "Don't scratch that box, you know what our orders say."

"Yeah, yeah," the shorter one replies, standing back up as they remove both lids in unison.  After a week, the fresh air that enters is heavenly-- and feels nearly as good as your fears of discovery being quickly squashed.

"Pull the boxes, affix a new label, change the trackers inside," the Officer continues, as if speaking a carefully prepared script.  "We've done this a hundred times, stop worrying."

"I *always* worry with these dolls," the partner responds.  "Most of these jobs are just cheap auction trash, but only the rich would own one of these slaves.  Imagine messing that up."

The bolder one rolls her eyes, then reaches down, plucking the vibrator wand in your box-- listed as an included accessory-- out from its slot.  Her other hand settles on your hip, the smooth curve emphasized by the corset still embracing you so tightly.

"Stop.  Worrying!"

[[Wriggle in your bondage.->CorShip17A]]
[["Mmmmmgh..."->CorShip17A]]


:: CorShip17A
"See how well trained these are?" The bolder Officer asks, having noticed your subdued response.  "She's been in there for a week, and what happens the moment I grab this vibe?  She wants it."
(set: $Strike to 0)
*Had that been your intent?*

"They're *trained* to want it, or to act like they do," the partner responds.  "Come on, se--"

She's ignored by the wand-armed Officer.  "Do you want the vibe, doll?  It would be a terrible burden, locked in your cute little box.  But you would be all nice at wet for your Master, or Mistress-- whoever owns you."

Turning, she looks to Corinth.  "Oh-- or maybe *this* doll wants it?  Hmm?  How about this, I'll set one of you up with it.  Whichever one begs for it harder.  How does that sound?  Good?  Good.  Let me hear it."

At your side Corinth moans with wild abandon, the sound of her squirming against her restraints clearly audible.  She wants it, at the very least.  *Bad*.

(link-reveal: "You want it, beg-- HARD!")[[[  "MMMMMmmmmGHHH!"->CorShip18A]]]

:: CorShip18A
The other Officer sighs as you and Corinth moan in unison, your friend begging harder for the torturous pleasure that would another long internment with that wand.

"Don't be like that," comes the response.  "Come on, you know she deserves it.  No one ends up as one of these fuck dolls without thinking solely with her cunt."

The partner looks upon the scene, glistening violet bodies struggling against box restraints, then sighs again.  "Fine, but seal them back in afterward.  They have to be on the train back to Grand Aekora in like, a half hour."

And with that she departs, leaving you with the Officer, the vibrating wand, and a steady approach towards Corinth.

You have no more the means to resist then a doll, and the Officer knows it.  Sliding the wand up between your legs, your own thighs pulled so tightly together by the intervening straps ensuring it could not move, she grins brightly.

"How's that?  Not good enough, I bet.  You want it *on*."  And with a flick of her thumb, it is, the rounded tip vibrating fiercly.  You can feel it in your thighs, and much more alarmingly against the zipper guarding your womanhood-- such defenses providing little actual help as the assaulting waves of sensation begin working through you.

"Better?  Good."  Pulling your lid back over, she slots it into place upon your box.  The locks are reinstalled afterward, as a bit of drool runs down your chin.  Once again you're looking out the plastic panel that was your box's display port, through which the Officer looks.

She waves.  "Enjoy your trip back the other way, dolly..."

Moaning quietly in your little box, the doll you had been forced to imitate can only endure (if: $Strike is 0)[the wand](else:)[Corinth's self-sought torture].  But endure you do, two weeks of mindnumbing immobility, strict bondage, and tight laminate finally come to an end as you're unloaded once more.   Just *where* you are isn't clear until your box and Corinth's are positioned upright side-by-side upon a handcart, a man apparently signing for you before leaning you back to begin walking.  Above you the Way Up looms, close-- so very close.

Eventually you enter into a door, moving down several side passages before coming to a stop inside what appears to be a massive warehouse.  Duraplastic containers are stacked all about, almost forming a small ring of privacy within the space your doll boxes are finally removed from the cart and leaned up against.

Looking in, the man swings a key around his finger.  "Ready to come out?"

[[Surely he jests.->CorShip22]]

He is.  Working down the locks on each side of your box, he finally removes the lid(if: $Strike is 0)[-- then notices the vibrator, pulling that out first] before addressing the straps securing you in place.  Once those are free you try to lurch forward, a firm hand on your shoulder holding you in place-- before he offers a hand.

"Two weeks in that getup, and those boots?  You ain't gonna want to walk, honey."  The truth is evident as you slowly slide free from the custom molding of the box, only to collapse, his strong hands the only thing keeping you upright.  Carefully he guides you over to what appears to be a cot, that he helps you sit down on.  Then he pulls out your gag.

"Had a wild ride, huh?"  He asks, to which Corinth can only moan quietly.]  Guiding her over, she is seated beside you-- and promptly collapses back, jaw shifting around the ball still locked between her teeth.

"Well," he returns to your side, a thin blade in hand.  Pressing it against your armbinder, it comes apart with surprising ease.  "You've made it to your destination.  Two weeks behind schedule and in a *very* interesting manner, but you made it-- just as my better half promised.  Obviously I'm removing your binder, but I don't exactly have clothes for you.  So you'll be wearing that on your way out of here."

He pulls the armbinder away, your arms nearly screaming from the sudden liberty allowed them.  After so long restrained, remaining strictly bound almost seemd the greater mercy.  "So I'll provide you with a ticket for the Way Up, and you can be on your merry way."

He disappears around a container's corner, leaving you alone for a brief period.  It's your first time to truly reflect on what you had just endured-- the means by which you had escaped.  Looking down upon the tight laminate still cloaking your body, you work at stretching your arms and working your jaw, both prickling with firey pain as they're allowed to move once more.

Had you truly *enjoyed* the two weeks spent inside that box?  The way all who had looked upon you had seen a *doll* worth thousands of credits, a Torean rarity?  Did freedom not pale a bit when compared to a life lived so strangely, as a thing in glossy laminate, a cherished possession?

Jacob shrugs, handing over the ticket before he offers a hand, pulling you to your feet.  Two weeks of immobilization could not be overcome by ten minutes seated, but you feel strong enough to at least walk for yourself.

Bidding the man goodbye, he points you towards a door on the far side of the terminal, through which you emerge into the public international zone.

He gives a rueful look.  "Thought you looked the type.  Come on then."

Approaching, he snaps the leash to your collar, then gives a light tug.   Two weeks of immobilization could not be overcome by ten minutes seated, but you feel strong enough to at least walk for yourself, which Jacob eases by setting an easy pace.  Crossing the warehouse you pass together through a door that leads back to the public international zonem and there find a very different sort of crowd.  Where Grand Aekora and its outskirts had been dominated by native Toreans and those bold enough to venture far from the the Way Up, and thus were almost universally in laminate, you had seen the Customs Enclave had been mixing that *very* distinct aesthetic with offworlder textiles-- and now here, on the far side of the border, your continued laminate is as distinct as could possibly be.

All eyes turn to you, staring at your laminate outfit, gawking at your staggering heels, leering at the leash running to your collar.  For many of them **you** are their first taste of Torei, and it shows.  All you can do is keep your eyes forward, however, focusing on your steps and making your way carefully through the main concourses.  Crossing that takes a few more minutes, but eventually you do arrive at the gates of the Way Up itself.

Approaching, he snaps the leash to your collar, the repeats the process with Corinth before he gives a light tug.   Two weeks of immobilization could not be overcome by ten minutes seated, but you feel strong enough to at least walk for yourself, which Jacob eases by setting an easy pace.  Corinth is your identical twin at your side.  Crossing the warehouse you pass together through a door that leads back to the public international zonem and there find a very different sort of crowd.

:: CorKey [Debt]
"Excellent," Anastasia replies, tapping out a command into her glass.  Then she waits, patiently, until the requisite credits are indeed drained from your account.  Once it does, you're treated to perhaps Anastasia's first pleased expression-- although quickly it turns predatory.  She leans over table, one hand upon it. 
(set: $debt to it - 200)
"You both will be departing immediately-- the cover of darkness perhaps helping.  All you need to do is tell the woman at the counter you want 'to take a walk.'"

Turning your head, you look across the small cafe to where the cafe's attendent is slowly cleaning out a teacup.  She looks bored.

[["Okay, I can do that."->CorKey4]]
[["That's it?"->CorKey4]]


:: CorKey4
Anastasia nods, then leans back with her teacup, pointedly dismissing you with her sudden disinterest.  Without anything left to do you stand, making your way over to the counter as indicated.

"Oh... I did not like *her*," Corinth whispers through her mask, having moved out of earshot.  Still, she watches her tongue as you approach the counter.

"What will it be, ma'am?"  The attendant manning it asks.

[["We would... like to take a walk?"->CorKey5]]


:: CorKey5
The attendent perks up at that, looking over your shoulder to where Anastasia remains seated.  To the unasked question the 'travel agent' nods, and that seems like all the attendent needs.

"Well then," she lifts the portion of the counter that allowed access to the area behind it.  "Follow me."

Without waiting for you, she disappears into the backroom.  As you hesistate Corinth steps forward, the black glossy of her laminate rear the last thing you see before she too disappears.

[[You're committed now.  Follow her!->CorKey6]]


:: CorKey6
The backroom is not large, primarily reserved for the storage of the cafe's various supplies, but against the far wall there is something unexpected-- a pair of wardrobe devices.  They appear a bit... bootleg, mounted on a rolling cart and being smaller then the official ones you've used thus far.  Beside them are a series of crates, in differing shapes and sizes.

Your guiding attendant ignores them completely however, instead moving towards an otherwise nondescript wall.  When she presses upon one of the durasteel bricks, however, it shifts-- revealing a hidden door, and a tunnel burrowed into it.

Producing a keycard, she offers it to Corinth-- who promptly hands it to you, as if not desiring the responsibility.   The attendant's eyes narrow, but she shrugs afterward, looking to you.

"Go down the hallway, fourth door-- only one on your right.  The others won't open, so don't try it."

[[Take the card.  "Understood."->CorKey7]]
[["What about after that?"->CorKey7A]]


:: CorKey7
You step into the secret tunnel, Corinth following, only to see the attendant turn back your way.  "Hey-- and good luck.  You'll need it."

And with that she closes the hidden wall, leaving you both in darkness.  The gloom reveals small lights set along the floor, providing you with an obvious path forward, but you still need to watch your footing-- the ground is uneven.

One, two, three, you count the doors passed on your left as instructed, until finally coming to another door-- this one on your right.

The attendant steps forward, looking to her left, as if she could see through steel and earth to the places beyond.  "You'll be outside, in the space between this terminal and the Way Up's international zone.  Look for the red door.  Get past that, and you're all gloss."

She gestures for you to leave.  "Now-- go, I need to get back up front in the Cafe."

[[You step towards the door.->CorKey7]]


:: CorKeyProm
(set: $Strike to 1)Behind the viewport of her heavy slave mask, you can see the relief in her eyes.  "I promise too."

Taking Anastasia's suggestion that this entire attempt could quickly devolve into a footrace, you against Truant Agents with your freedom on the line, you throw the door open-- ready for anything.

The darkness of the tunnel meets the quiet dark of the garden beyond, carefully sculpted bushes arranged around a fountain from your point of view, but the sound of the door-- or perhaps your hurried movement-- seems to have drawn immediate attention.  A spotlight suddenly ignites, hellishly bright in comparison, from the rooftop of the Terminal you now stand ready to exit.  Corinth groans quietly behind you.

Still-- you see your goal in the distance, a door that would have been too dark to make out had it not been for the red light blinking above it.  You're so close-- and the way is remarkably clear, an empty expanse of grass before you.

[[Try to sneak along the edge of the open area.->CorSneak]]

Carefully, mindful of every possible squeak from the archaic sort of hinged door, you work it open.

The darkness of the tunnel meets the quiet dark of the garden beyond, carefully sculpted bushes arranged around a fountain from your point of view.  Oddly, there are no signs of guards-- the way across is nothing more then a broad expanse of grass.

[[They will see you anyway, run for it!->CorRun]]
[[Try to sneak along the edge of the open area.->CorSneak]]


:: CorSneak
Cautiously you lead Corinth in edging along the side of the grassy plain, a choice that proves well considered when you notice several small metallic *things* gleaming in the grass just before the door you had exited.  Mines of some sort?

Either way you avoid them, but about halfway across another peril befalls you-- a searchlight arcing across the grass, then along the wall you're moving along.  It will reach you any moment.

Staying along the wall is safer, but will expose you-- even running will not escape that rapidly approaching light.  Otherwise you could break out across the grass, watching as best you can for mines.

[[Stay along the wall!->CorSneak2Cor]]

Breaking from the doorway, you make for the door as fast as you can manage.  Your third step reveals how little speed would matter, however, when several small devices jump up suddenly from the grass.  *Motion-activated mines* your mind identifies, moments before they discharge in a flash of blinding light.

It takes your eyes a good minute to regain vision, but by then you already know you're in trouble.  You had fallen, unable to get up-- the *why* explained when you can finally look down, revealing the thick laminate straps that have wrapped around your body.  A few feet back Corinth wriggles in a similar state, having already rolled onto her back, screaming in surprise-- a difficult enough endeavor given her regulating mask.

A flash of light, binding straps being launched in all directions?  You've fallen into a typical Torean security device, and already you can hear voices approaching as a spotlight upon the Terminal circles your fallen form in a halo of bright light.

It takes some time for the Truant Officers that find you to extricate you and Corinth from your predicaments, but they manage, eventually securing your hands behind your back as they march you back towards the Terminal.  Arrested in the act of an attempted illegal border crossing, you're informed of the gravity of your situation-- and the fact that it will take some time before your trial.  Until then, you both will be a guest of the Ministry of Truants.

Despite it all, freedom retreats much like the glimmering Way Up behind you, so close yet now eternally out of reach.  This will earn you a collar, certainly, and who could tell what would happen then?  

You're truly lost in laminate now.

"Prisoner #38511b, this court finds you *guilty.*"

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you've been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant's uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you've grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)["Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now."

Alarms in the distance announce you've been discovered, but you're already three quarters of the way to the door, and making good time...

...but Corinth is not behind you.  Having seen the same oncoming danger she had chosen instead to make for the grass, a decision that quickly proves ill-considered.

You're greeted with a good hundred or so tourists and offworlders gawking at your laminated form, the intensive bondage of your slave suit very different from most of their textiles.

Slowly you slide down, now breathing deeply, panting even, as your hands seem to work of their own accord--- one finding your own breast, the other sliding down between your legs.

Before you one of the canisters burns out, the pink mist now filling the courtyard.  Just what was in that?  And why... why was it making you so **aroused?**  You cannot help yourself, in fact, as you begin fiercly rubbing between your own legs.

"What?"  Masked as she is, you can only imagine Corinth blushing.  "I was just... uh..."

Apparently lying isn't one of her strong suits, a fact she seems to come to terms with after a very awkward silence.  "Alright... uh... *yeah.*  I just... wanted to see how it felt, you know?  I saw... things on my way over here, how some others wearing this suit were treated... and I was curious, I guess."

[["I guess that's alright, Corinth..."->CorHub]]

"Right, yeah," Corinth replies, glancing down.  You can only imagine she's distracted by her plugs, and trying very hard not to show it.  Trying and failing.

"Do you... have a plan?"  She asks.  "I don't have... anywhere near enough experience with Torei, you know?  So I'm relying on you.  If I don't get over the border... I don't know what would happen, dressed like this, without any credits to my name."

"It's... different then I expected, because when you put this on me... I couldn't believe you did it, that anyone could... *like* this.  But..."

Corinth takes a second to work up the courage, but she manages it.  "... I *do* like it.  More then I ever thought I would.  The sense of being on display, of it being so tight, of being... almost helpless.  It's... it's been a lot to take in, you know?  In a good way."

[[A lot to take in, indeed...->CorHub]]


:: CorCredits
(set: $CorCredits to true)"Oh, yeah," Corinth replies, pulling forth her personal ID.  "Obviously we can always pull from the company account for purchases, but that only works on the space-station in orbit-- and I kinda sorta maybe didn't bring as many credits down the Way Up as I should of."

Her sheepish tone brightens as she pulls forth her ID card, simple proximity allowing her to transfer credits from it.  "So I've only got the 50 credits, but I'm giving them to you right now, alright?  Use them however you think is best, I trust you."
(set: $debt to it + 50)

Corinth had been idly watching a pair of tourists wandering by, but her attention snaps back to you immediately upon hearing those words.  "Stay?"  She asks, sounding a bit incredulous.  "Here?  On Torei?  How... how do you mean?"

[["I... don't really know, I guess.  What do you think?"->CorStayDunno]]

"Uh-- *yeah*," Corinth replies.  "It's really cute."

It takes her a moment to realize what she had just said.  "I mean-- is that a **collar**?  And that looks like a uniform!  What happened since we last talked, you said you were going to a Club of some sort, right?"

You fill her in on the peculiar path you had walked through the violet den of vice and neon that had been Club Lush.  Of the Wardrobe Device, of your using the uniform you were now locked into to reach the VIP balcony.  And, of course, of the contract you had signed to achieve it all.

"Gosh," your friend breathes afterward.  (if: $CorSlave is true)["I was going to say that I can't imagine what it's like, to wear something like that... with such a short skirt, that collar, the way everyone must look at you like a servant..."

"Oh I'm so happy you think the same!"  She exclaims, pulling you into a neat little hug.  Her grip is surpisingly fierce, one of her heeled feet pulling up and kicking out behind her in a flourish of emotion.  (if: $Textile is true)[Her laminate is so very slick against your offworlder clothing.](else:)[Chest to chest in glossy laminate, you draw several looks from thos passing nearby.]

Eventually she does release you, stepping back, hands going behind her back as she positively beams.

[[You seem to recall Corinth always having been excitable.->CorHub]]


:: CorOutNo
Her bright mood darkens, a frown pulling across lips painted so carefully by the Wardrobe Machine.  "Well... I'm sorry, you're right of course... Torei is... everything about this planet we should be careful of, right?  Even the laminate.  *Especially* the laminate.  (if: $Textile is true)[Is that why you changed into that outfit?

She sighs.  "Sorry, we should really be focusing on getting off Torei, huh?"

[["Yes we should."->CorHub]]


:: CorOutSlave
Her eyes widen, lips opening in momentary shock.  "...oh?  Really?  Well it certainly looks... *intense.*"

Corinth allows her gaze to run up and down the black laminate of your uniform, every curve very much on display to her-- and anyone else who sought to take a look.  She seems to come to a conclusion but then holds back from saying it aloud, delaying instead by glancing about.

"Well... you look good in it," she finally manages, finding the courage to meet your eyes.  "Maybe it does suit you..."

[[She leaves it there.->CorHub]]


:: CorHistory
"Our history?"  It takes a moment for her to realize what you meant.  "Oh-- you mean... because you can't remember much, right?  Wow, yeah... maybe we should have done that before?  I guess it doesn't matter, we can certainly do it now!  Whatever you want to ask, I'll try to tell you."

She leans in (if: $CorSlave is true)[winking through the viewport of her mask](else:)[winking towards you].  "I'm probably the best person in the galaxy to do that, after all.  So... hit me!"

[["Tell me... more about me."->CorTor]]

[["Tell me more about my job."->CorJob]]
[["Do I have... family?"->CorFam]]
[["Do we have any other resources to use?"->CorResources]]


:: CorFriends
"We *are* friends," Corinth corrects, immediately.  "Grew up together!  May not have been... you know, buddy-buddy all the time, but we both wanted to get off Tor Four together-- so we did!  The way our jobs work we don't exactly get to hang out often, but we kept in touch, and when I heard you had missed your check-in time with corporate... that's when I was called in to find you!"

[["Well, thanks for coming after me."->CorQ]]
[["You didn't need to do that."->CorQ]]


:: CorJob
"Oh yeah!  Well, you might remember bits of this-- we work for Steris Trans-Galactic.  It's a consortium, a big one, and if you want to be specific our department was in acquisitions.  The universe is so big and full of different settlements, governments, and organizations that important things can often stay rather local.  Our job was to find those things, new biotech advancements, rare plants, whatever-- and bring them to Steris.  The pay isn't much better then decent, but the main perk is hard to beat: the opportunity to travel wherever you want!  And that's what led you here, I guess.  To Torei."

[["That does sound familiar."->CorQ]]


:: CorFam
"Not that I'm aware of," Corinth replies immediately, her finger flicking out to emphasize the point.  "And I would know, I think.  We grew up together, after all!"

[[Had she not come, would anyone have missed you?->CorQ]]


:: CorTor
"About you... right," Corinth folds one arm beneath her chest, the other leading up to her chin, which she taps in thought.  "Well, you're from the colony world of Urzan Tor IV-- Tor Four to everyone else.  So am I!  It... isn't exactly an exciting place.  Very frontier, which makes sense, it was only settled in the last colonization wave.  Most people are homesteaders, the sort who will live on Tor Four their entire lives, you know?  But we wanted something different.  So when we hit majority we signed up with Steris Trans-Galactic, and that's how we became... prospectors!"

[["I see."->CorQ]]


:: CorResources
"Oh yeah," Corinth nods, only for her face to scrunch up.  "Well... sorta, I guess.  If we contact our employers, Steris, they provide the credits necessary to travel, for supples, lodgings, everything-- although obviously that comes out of the eventual bounty cuts we bring them in return.  But the catch is that Torei is too isolated for that.  Their credit network here is isolated, you have to exchange your chit for a Torean one upon arrival.  And communication can be hard-- you basically need a contact, or contract with one of the Torean businesses, near the space elevator to send data."

She sighs.  "So we're pretty cut off down here.  Once we make it up to the spaceport on the far end of the elevator, though?  Shouldn't be a problem from there."

(if: $CorCredits is false)["Oh!  But I do have those fifty credits, still-- you can have them, if you want.  JUst ask.]

:: CorWanted2
You go over your time in the Club more thoroughly, the trials and tribulations that had led to your current issues with Aekora's form of law enforcement.  It's a story that Corinth listens to with increasing worry.

"They won't let you through the checkpoint to the Way Up with that record," she notes.  "But... we already sort of knew that, I guess.  We'll have to figure something out.  We *must*.  Right?"

[["Right."->CorHub]]

:: CorArrest2
You explain the predicament you had been placed in, your caging alongside the other Truants.  Corinth looks rather horrified at the entire story, at yet follows your every word as if with bated breath.  Was she...  enjoying the idea of being locked into such a situation?

She doesn't comment on that, instead breaking from her state to lean in.  "Why... were they after you, then?"

[[Tell her.->CorWanted2]]

"Are you actually going to *do* that?"  She asks, eyes wide.  "Just... give yourself up, like that?  They will enslave you!  There... there has to be another way, right?"

[["No way-- I'll find some way out of this."->CorArrestNarcNo]]

Only then does she seem to notice her hard-driving attitude.  Stepping back, looking a little sheepish, she sighs.  "I just meant... well... how did it happen, anyway?  That they wanted to arrest you?"

[[Tell her.->CorWanted2]]

"Good."  She seems intensely relieved.  "I'm certain you can find some other way to handle the situation, right?(if: $CorSlave is true)[  Going with them would split us up, anyway.  I can't get across the border in this outfit... so you better not leave me behind!]"

"That sounds... *wow*," your friend finally manages, afterward.  "To be... collared like that?  Here?  I... I would be too afraid to do it alone, you know?  But if you were there, even just through training..."

She paces back and forth, trying to think it out, but the movement only shifts her plugs-- earning a quiet moan, but perhaps inducing her answer.

(set: $CorStat to 6)You can't see much of Corinth's face behind her mask, but you get the sense she's smiling as she reaches out, taking your hand in her's.

"Lead the way."

Guiding Corinth by the hand, you eventually return to Celeste Academy's quiet office-- and Veronica, still immaculate.  She eyes Corinth readily upon entering, and even more aggressively once you explain your intentions.  Questions follow, for both you and Corinth.  Why were you seeking to enroll?  Why do you want this?  Do you understand you may not be kept together?"

It all comes down to a singular question, given to you both.

"Do you truly wish this?"

Veronica holds your gaze for a long time, looking into your eyes, perhaps determining if you measured up.  Her conclusion, when it comes, arrives suddenly-- she stands.  A small desk is situated in the corner of the otherwise desolate room, and it is from that edifice that she retrieves a glassboard.

"By signing this provisional contract, you both will be waiving all personal rights and responsibilities to Celeste Academy, pursuant to its foundational charter.  This is effectively the same as being collared immediately, but we leave it open to provide for revisions that more closely suit your position going forward once we assign you a final role and begin training for that."

She's reading of the glassboard, but turns it around to you now, a litany of text running in stark neon down the front-- until it ends with a singular line intended for a signature.  Signing away one's liberty was a simple enough thing, on Torei.

Offering it to you, she then pulls forth a pair of simple circles of silver, unadorned but clearly featuring a heavy lock on the back.  Two collars.  *Your* collar, and Corinth's.  Even looking over the contract you can see it there, a gleaming promise in Veronica's hands as she asks perhaps the most important question of your life.

"Do you submit?"

(if: $Servant is true)[Aligning it with your throat, just below the collar you had received at Club Lush,](else:)[Aligning it with your throat,] she closes it slowly, the interior band pulling tighter as she does, cinching so as to provide as tight an embrace as possible. When her hands withdraw it remains, just uncomfortable enough that its presence could never be forgotten.

Veronica smiles from above you.  "Welcome to Celeste Academy."  Then she turns to Corinth.  "Your turn."

Your friend looks to you, looks to your new collar, swallows deeply... and then begins writing her name upon the glassboard.

[[So close to the Way Up, but all but impossible to reach now...->CprEnrollPass4]]


:: CprEnrollPass4
Several hours later you lay on the small padded portion of a cell, Veronica having led you to the room located just behind the public area of the Academy's small refuge.  You would be taken to Celeste's campus in the morning, and until then you would be kept here-- just another collared slave locked inside a cage, awaiting a fate she could no longer control.

How had it come to this?  Was that terror, existential and overwhelming, that you felt in your heart-- or a trembling *thrill*?  Reaching up, you slowly run a finger along the silver restraint now locked to your neck, marking you readily as something less then human.  You're... property now, of a sort.  A student to be trained fully in the culture and expectations of this planet, to be shaped and molded into something truly... *Torean.*  A creature of pleasure wrapped into laminate.

At your side, Corinth sleeps fitfully, the silver collar around her neck so very bright.

Corinth isn't here beside you, but the Wardrobe provides a virtually unlimited selection of options for you to run through, and recreating her situation-- in a slave suit, locked in for a few hours, paid for by you-- is easily done.  The results, however, are unexpected.

*Early removal of a slave suit involves a termination fee,* the Wardrobe warns.  *This fee is tripled for short term confinement, as your settings have indicated have occured.  There is a contract stripping fee, for the breaking of an agreed upon submission agreement between the suit wearer and the payer of the original suit's fines.  These fees are also tripled, for given the lateness of the current day.*

The bad news is summed up near the bottom, in bold letters:

Afterward Elizabeth returns to you.  "You're good to go.  Tell the attendant at the counter there you want 'the slave's special', and she will take you for preparation."

The judge reigning over your case delivers the judgement to the quiet disinterest of the court, your fate having been decided upon in the short space of a few hours.  Despite the brevity you've been a prisoner of the Ministry of Truants for several months now, and have grown accustomed to the sense of being little more then a number in the system.  Kneeling before the raised dais, your arms are pinned by the bright orange straitjacket that constituted the majority of your Truant's uniform.  Beneath it you wore a simple black catsuit, while at your throat you've grown used to the tight cling of your tall, heavy collar.  Steel hardpoints, two to each side, are often used to afix the poles or leashes so often used upon Truants.

The Judge continues, reading from his docket.  (if: $Servant is true)["Regarding the circumstances related to  your enslavement by the proprietor of *Club Lush*, this Court finds that contract to be valid, but unorthodox.  Thus you will be given a choice: to either accept the terms of your contract with the Club, and thus enter into slavery upon its premises... or to choose the opportunity for retraining and sale.  In this secondary circumstance, the ownership rights upon your person would be stripped from you, and you would be given training until such time as you can be auctioned by this Ringdom.  You would, however, quite obviously still be a slave, and would be registered as a contract-jumper-- which could influence your opportunities with regards to earning another collar.  Still... the choice is yours.  Speak it now."

Nikaido crosses her arms below her chest.  "An Officer of the Ministry of Truants is primarily tasked with enforcing the laws of the Ringdom to which she is assigned.  Given this is Aekora, you would have full lawful and procedural powers.  That means arresting anyone in violation of the laws, and punishing them as appropriate.  Sometimes that means delivering correction on the street, as you see fit.  Often that means bringing them in, for trial, the Machinery of Corrections-- or both."

"Correct," Nikaido replies.  "But you would not be free, either.  Conscript Officers have firm restrictions on their manner of living, their free time, and of course their work.  You can eventually work these off, much like an indentured servant, but you will be held to them until then.  That means full arrest quotas.  Fail to make *those*, and the commissioned Officer to who you are assigned will ensure you are punished for such poor work."

She smiles.  "My squad *always* makes its quotas, or my Officers wish they had."

"Almost certainly.  Each conscripted Officer is assigned to a commissioned Officer, which I am.  You would be serve beneath me, as I will.  And I like to think of myself as fair with my girls.

"A poor choice, but yours to make," she replies, stepping up behind you.  Gently taking your wrists, she guides them together behind your back.  There you're cuffed, only then does she undo the spreader bar.

"The proper choice," Nikaido concludes, with a decisive nod.  "Good.  It will take a few weeks to get all the paperwork taken care of, and then there will be your training, but you will be in uniform quite soon."

Walking behind you, she gently guides your wrists together, then links them behind your back with a set of cuffs.  Only then does she undo your spreader bar, allowing you the freedom to walk as she guides you, a firm hand on your shoulder.

Dawn approaches, and with it your deadline.  A conscripted Officer who missed her quota could often have it worse then the Truants she was supposed to bring in, you've learned that over these last few months.  But you're close-- needing only this last collar.  So why are you staring at the dead end of an alley?
(set: $Strike to 0)(set: $Status to 6)
You followed her here, your mark, after she ran.  Offworlders often proved rather ungainly in Torean-style heels, but she had set a good pace in your footrace, turning the corner into this alley just ahead of you.  And now she's disappeared.  You have to work quickly, find her-- take too long and she *will* get away.

Anastasia, in her black catsuit.  She doesn't look happy.

"When we first met," she begins, ignoring your confusion.  "What did I tell you?  Warn you?"

[["I... don't remember?"->NarcFail5A]]
[["To not... fuck with you?"->NarcFail5]]

"Think *harder*," she snaps, slapping you sharply across the face. (if: $Slave is true)[Your mask thankfully absorbs the blow.](else:)[Your cheek smarts in her wake, prodding you to remember.]

"To not fuck with me," Nikaido repeats, nodding.  "And what did you do?  You tried to fuck with me.  Did you think I wouldn't know, if you tried to turn me into the Ministry of Truants?  I told you, I *told* you that I own them around here.  They need me.  Every port needs its back door, and if a few slaves slip out it who cares?  Nikaido doesn't, that's why she called me."

She lets the name drop take its due course, before snapping her fingers together.  "Arms behind your back."

"It's too late for that," the smuggler replies.  "This entire thing only works because everyone has mutual respect.  If the Ministry thinks I'm weak, they would pounce on me.  So, sometimes, I need to make an example."

She gestures towards you.  "Arms behind your back."

[[Place your hands behind your back.->NarcFail6]]

Submitting, you move your arms behind your back.  Anastasia follows, producing a pair of cuffs that she uses to secure them there-- making your helplessness even more apparent.  Afterward she returns to a position before you, a *glass* device held in her hand.  Tapping out a few commands, the spreader bar holding your legs apart trembles, the center portion moving upward, a pole emerging.  Its tipped with a (if: $Plugs is true)[concave surface, clearly intended to come up between your legs, and thus against the plugs you already bear.](else:)[a pair of phallic spears.  They could only have one purpose.]

"You're not getting Nikaido's offer," Anastasia continues, meanwhile.  "Whatever it was.  No-- you're going to be on display here, as a warning to others for a few days.  Then you're going back to the Ministry, for the full treatment.  Trial, probably enslavement-- and I'm going to make sure there is a nice, big, black mark on your record."

[["Stop whatever you're doing!"->NarcFail7A]]

"Freewombs are always sent to the Academy, for training, when they're enslaved.  I can't control what they do with you there, but I *can* have you start with a nice demerit on your record.  You in a collar will be enough, but here's hoping you end up as a mindless ponygirl, or a fucktoy. I don't really care."

Between your legs the rising bar reaches the meeting of your thighs.  (if: $Plugs is true)[There hard nubs press against your plugs, driving them deeper into you.](else:)[There Anastasia assists in their installation, eventually allowing them to continue their rise, pressing deep into your womanhood and rear.]  The sensation of being filled, of being taken, only grows more intense with every passing moment.  Just as you think it cannot get worse it *does*, as your feet leave the ground, putting your entire weight upon the plugs and the narrow bit of attending metal that supported them.

As your feet leave the ground your new predicament becomes clear, to be impaled upon the plugs inside you, then lifted up and put on public display-- and Anastasia had suggested she would leave you like this, for days.

"How does that feel, bitch?" Anastasia sneers.

Your pleas fall on deaf ears.  Instead Anastasia steps closer, openly caressing your chest, then running a finger along your chin.  With your arms bound, you are helpless before her.

"Enjoy your last few days of freedom," Anastasia declares, turning from you with a little wave.  "The Officers will come for you in a few days."

The smuggler sighs.  "Should have known you would be too much of a wet cunt for this to be a punishment-- at first.  That's why you're going to stay right there, for a few days.  So-- enjoy your last few days of freedom," Anastasia declares, turning from you with a little wave.  "The Officers will come for you in a few days."

You can struggle, but that only leads to a slight rocking, your intruders answering with pangs of aching pleasure between your legs.  Nor can you escape the attention your very public situation produces, especially in a place so near the Way Up.  Tourists gawk by the dozens, crowds building for awhile around you with every newly arrived elevator carriage.

It's a fate you're forced to endure for a few days, just as Anastasia had warned.  After that they come for you, Officers of the Ministry, but only to clap you in further restraints, to take you away as a Truant.  Prison, a trial, and whatever came beyond that awaits.

The pulse between your legs is mild, but any response from your clit piercing demanded attention.  Turning on the floor of Club Lush, you glance about, the HUD built into your glasses highlighting the table that had called you.

"I told you the Offworlder wouldn't be respectful, the woman says to her husband with a smirk.  "A proper Torean would have lifted her skirt."

Reaching down, you grab the hemline of your skirt, lifting it to more fully reveal your panties beneath.  Matched with a bowing of your head and slight curtsy, its a picture perfect display of Torean submission.

"Consider me impressed," the woman muses, looking to the man.  "Apparently you *can* teach an offworlder a few things.  Certainly her collar helps, hm?"

Backing off from the table you cross Club Lush's floor to the booming beat of the band performing upon its stage, strobe lights roaming freely across the patrons in laminate-- and your own tight dress.

Approaching the bar you find its tender busy, forcing you to wait-- slaves were always addressed last.  But he does eventually find the time for you, his smile gentle as he approaches.  You know him, how could you not?  Club Lush's owner had been rumored to work the bar, and now you know that to be true, as he-- and thus *your* owner-- seemed to find the work amusing.

"What do you need, dear?"  He asks, running a rag along the glass top.

You feel it before even noticing his hand had shifted to the bar's control panel, but the result is unavoidable: a sharp shock, enamating from the piercing in your clit, a Club Lush standard.  Finishing off the requested drinks, your owner slides the tray to you.

"You will remember your place, is that clear, slave?  Everything should end with *Master.*"

"Remember to work your hips more, as you walk," he suggests, as you turn back around.  Nevertheless you can feel his eyes upon you as you retreat, and that's enough incentive to follow his request-- you shimmy your hips seductively, carefully placing each foot before each other on your way across the floor.

Your patrons certainly seem to notice the change, both eyes landing upon you as you reach their table.  Setting the tray down with the flourish you have been taught, you stand back.

Reaching to the small console that each table bore, the man depresses his finger upon it.  You're rewarded with a sharp purr of vibration between your legs, riding your most sensative of nerves straight up your spine.  A small moan slips from your lips as your feet momentarily twist inward, standing pidgeon-toed as you hold a hand to your skirt-- just barely fighting the urge to rub further at your clit.

The couple you're currently with have turned away, allowing you to perform a second reverence in short order, then turn and leave.

Making your way to the foyer, you find a man staring in stark wonder at Lush's cacophony of Torean excess.  The music, the sounds, the women-- you're particularly representative of the latter as you step up to him in your shiny laminate uniform, Club Lush's standardized greeting already on your lips.

"Holy hells..." the man replies, still turning in a slow arc.  He's wearing laminate, but clearly looks uncomfortable in it.  A tourist, freshly arrived, you determine easily.

He's a bit late in noticing you were speaking to *him*, and when he looks your way he does a double-take, both trying to avoid staring and proving remarkably incapable of it.  "H-Hi..." he manages, eyes widening as he glimpses your panties.

"I think... I took I tried the high dive first, and that's a bad idea, if you know what I mean..."

"No, no," the man says, breaking away from you.  "This was a mistake... I need to take this whole... Torei thing a bit slower, I think.  Thank you, uh... ma'am, but I really need to be going."

He's gone, back out the door.  It's not a good look, losing a patron so quickly, but you have other concerns-- other tables to serve.  Focusing on them the rest of the night passes quickly, until you're seeing out the last utterly drunk customer before closing the front door and locking it.

Your feet are aching from being in such heels all night, your laminate is scuffed and less than glossy in a few places, and you're quite hungry-- but your duties are not over.  Cleaning follows, as a slave you join with the other uniformed girls in collecting glasses, scrubbing the floors, and otherwise preparing Lush for another opening the coming evening.  Those who merely worked for the Club, the bouncers and bartenders, the support staff-- they watch, even dirtying a few more glasses you're forced to wash before departing as well.

Your breasts, covered by the slick laminate of your uniform, press gently against his chest.  Just above your hands join them, palms against his pectorals, so strong and masculine despite his timidity.  You can feel his breath catch in his throat, yet he remains still, as if waiting to see what you would do next.

Carefully you slide your hands to his shoulders, then run down his biceps.  Finding his wrists, you seize them with your gloved hands, and then slowly shift them towards you.  Guiding him, you settle his hands upon your waist, just above where your skirt flared.  He openly marvels, but instincts override his reservations and he takes over from there.  Exploring your tight waist he moves down your hips, over your skirts and petticoat before gliding underneath.  Only when his palms are upon your rear, holding you possessively, does he look back to your eyes.

Carefully you lean in, moving your hands up his shoulders to his neck, where one gloved hand slides behind his head to help bend him down-- into reach.  Your pink-painted lips make contact gently, one of your legs rising coquettishly behind.  When you pull back he stares at you wide-eye-- then breaks from his reservations, finally.  His hands advance, exploring your tight waist before he moves down your hips, over your skirts and petticoat before gliding underneath.  Only when his palms are upon your rear, holding you possessively, does he look back to your eyes.

He smiles, matching your own, as you eventually break from the embrace-- and guide him to a table.  The man may have been skittish, but he proves to have deep pockets, spending lavishly for the rest of the evening.  He eventually leaves just before dawn, utterly spent, and incredibly drunk.  Still, you provide a parting kiss when requested, seeing him out before closing the front door and locking it.

He steps before you.  (if: $Strike is 0)["And what a poor night it was, I'm afraid.  I received complaints from a couple that you failed to show them due respect, and then mistakenly brought them the wrong order?  This is most unacceptable, I'm sure you know that."

"You will need to do better, going forward, he notes.  "Another night like this, and I will give you one off-- in a corrections chair, edging you to the point of climax so long you truly start thinking with your cunt.

Yet the reward continues, driving you closer and closer to sweet release, orgasm-- only for your Master to halt it there.  Wet and moaning, you look up to him.

It may feel like night, deep in the backrooms of Club Lush, but the clock upon the wall announces it to be just passed noon-- and thus your curfew.  Along with the other slaves you've been returned to your individual cages, the doors locked, the time yours as you will.  Without much to do, and knowing the coming night would see you working the Club's floor again, most of the other slaves are already asleep.  You lie away on your small cot however, one hand laying upon your waist, the other running a finger along your collar.

This is it: your life going forward.  Nights spent serving in the bar, coaxing money from tourists and Toreans alike.  Mornings cleaning.  And the day?  Reserved for sleep, as best you could find it while still in full uniform.  Master Kaleb will send you through the Wardrobe Device come evening, to refresh your outfit, but you best get used to laminate-- you'll be wearing it near constantly, going forward.

Who could have imagined this would be how it would end?  That morning, now long ago, where you had awoken chained to your own bed, memory full of holes but free.  Now?  Now you're just another slave on Torei, lost in laminate...

[[Sleep now, you will be back on your heels come nightfall.->Ending]]


:: Officer2
The alleyway may be missing its truant, but its not empty.  To your left a dumpster is pushed up against the wall, while to your right a door is boarded up.  Directly before you several discarded laminate shealfs lay haphazardly upon the floor.
(set: $Ending to 14)
[[Search that dumpster!->OffDump]]
[[Check that boarded door!->OffDoor]]
[[What are these shealfs?->OffShef]]


:: OffDump
Torean culture recycled most everything: food, laminate, materials of all sorts.  With how resource poor the planet remained it had long been a necessity, and in this instance at least keeps you from sullying your uniform as you quickly dig through what little could be found in the dumpster.

There is no truant to be found, however.
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[[Check that boarded door!->OffDoor]]
[[What are these shealfs?->OffShef]]


:: OffDoor
"Wood" and "trees" were largely foreign to Torei's environment, and thus its perhaps not very surprising that the boards used to seal the disused door are flash-forged laminate, thick and heavy, hard to break.  Hard enough in fact that you cannot remove them with a sharp yank, and they most certainly haven't been shifted in the last few minutes.  Your truant is not here.
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[[Search that dumpster!->OffDump]]
[[What are these shealfs?->OffShef]]


:: OffShef
Torei favored laminate for its aesthetic look, of course, but simple economics defined its use as well: it remained by far the cheapest material on Torei, used for all manner of purposes.  These appear to have formed something like a box or two once upon a time, but ripped apart and exposed to the elements its mostly just trash now, utterly useless.

But as you pull away the battered laminate you find something *else*.  A manhole cover, presumably leading to the local transit tunnels.  Your quarry must have fled downward!
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[[Follow her!->OffSewer]]


:: OffSewer
The manhole must have been open for your Truant to have fled so quickly down it, an ordinance violation you may very well have busied yourself with had you not more important things to worry about.  As it is you pull the grate open, heeled shoes hooking into each rung as you quickly clamber down.

Dismounting, you pull forth a small *glass* device, flicking it into action.  Light springs forth, although you would only need it heading one direction-- to your left the way is dark, pitch black even.  To your right however light can be seen in the distance.  You must pick a direction.  At the very least you know your prey did not have a flashlight herself.

[[Go left, down the dark path!->OffDarkSewer]]
[[Go right, down the light path!->OffLightPath]]


:: OffDarkSewer
Venturing to your left, you make your way down the pitch black pathway.  Much of the more mountainous portions of Torei were riddled with such passageways, some still being used for slaves to move products and packages, but most had been abandoned-- the Way Up having brought far too much commerce into the region for such narrow passages to provide for.  

More relevent however, is your inability to see the path ahead without your flashlight.  Had you been without it you doubt anyone could make out where they were going, a fact that dawns on you just as you hit a dead-end-- an ancient tunnel collapse sealing the path forward.  Your prey may have came here to hide, but without a flashlight she wouldn't have braved it herself on the run.  You've gone the wrong way!
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[[Turn around, head for the light!->OffLightPath]]


:: OffLightPath
Seeking the light, you're forced to take several turns, but luckily there aren't any branching paths-- you need only follow the dim reflections at each corner.  Eventually you make a turn and are greeted with a firm halo of sunlight ahead, an opening!

You emerge several streets below where you entered, Grand Aekora being particularly hilly as it approached the Way Up.  Of your Truant you still seem to be behind, and here there is no clear path forward-- the street is empty when you glance both ways.  

You're not without hope however, as there is another resource directly across the street, staring at you.  A freewomb in secretarial laminate, glancing over her shoulder your way as she searches her purse for a key to the building she's near.
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[["Stop right there!"->OffFW]]
[["Hey you!"->OffFW]]


:: OffFW
The woman finds her keys just as you hail her, which she promptly drops, thereby losing the slim opportunity to escape your attention.  Picking up her keys she collects herself, looking to you with an expression you've grown familiar with since conscription: a mixture of distress and distaste.  Few freewombs enjoyed your Ministry's attention, and most actively despised you.

"...y-yes, Officer?"

You don't have time for a long interrogation.

[["I need to ask you a few questions."->OffQ]]
[["Have you seen a young woman pass here?"->OffHave]]
[["Where is the woman who came from that tunnel?"->OffTun]]

(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[["Where is the woman who came from that tunnel?"->OffTun]]
[[Pull out your shock baton.  "Where is she?"->OffShock]]

Your eyewitness purses her lips.  "Is she... in some sort of trouble?  I don't really want to get involved."
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[["I'm asking the questions here, slut!  Tell me!"->OffSlu]]
[["Just tell me."->OffJust]]
[[Pull out your shock baton.  "Where is she?"->OffShock]]


:: OffShock
Pulling your shock baton from your hip gets her attention, the freewomb's eyes widening.  Quickly she points down the street.  "She went that way, towards the reservoir!"
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[[Finally!  Follow her!->OffRes]]


:: OffSlu
She doesn't look happy, but the freewomb does point down the road.  "That way, Officer.  Towards the reservoir."
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[[Finally!  Follow her!->OffRes]]


:: OffJust
The woman's lips pull into a tight line.  "Don't you have anything better to do then bother us freewombs?  Come on."
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
[["I'm asking the questions here, slut!  Tell me!"->OffSlu]]
[[Pull out your shock baton.  "Where is she?"->OffShock]]


:: OffRes
Running in heels was never easy, but the Ministry of Truants retained strict dress codes for its Officers.  Your training as a Cadet helps however, and as you turn the corner you see her-- running towards the reservoir.  Torei had precious little water, making the reservoir a strategic asset for the Ringdom.  Your truant appears to be less interested in the liquid wealth, making instead for an automated cleaning barge about to set out from the shore.  Circling the holding pond would take a good twenty minutes, you will have lost her by then!

(if: $Strike is < 5)[[[Run her down!->OffCatch]]]
(if: $Strike is > 4)[[[Run her down!->OffEscape]]]


:: OffCatch
You do remarkably well in what quickly becomes a footrace, but even so the distance you close isn't enough to seize hold of her.  Thinking quickly you reach for your belt, where a variety of Ministry enforcement devices hang-- although only two truly have the possibility of being useful right now.

[[Deploy the shock baton!->OffBaton]]
[[Pull forth the lam-gun!->OffGun]]


:: OffEscape
You make your best effort, but the Truant's lead is just too large.  Neither baton nor your restraint-gun are in range before she jumps aboard the barge, and it seperates from the dock.  Once safe she turns around, waving, a smile on her face.

She almost looks familiar, but at this range your curiosity-- and Truant quota-- goes unsated.

[[Either way, Nikaido won't be happy about this.->OffEscape2]]


:: OffEscape2
Your chamber is small, but clear, the walls some manner of transparent plastic.  It provides a nice view of your Precinct's yard, but such environs provide a second feature: the sunlight falling upon you is amplified and contained.  You're sweating from every pore, almost delirious with thirst, with your arms bound above you to the steel post your back is against.

You returned twelve hours ago having missed your quota.

Normally this little stake-out was reserved for particularly reticent guests of your Ministry, but Nikiado had thought you deserved the opportunity to think about your recent choices-- this isn't the first time you've failed her standards, and you sense she won't accept many more missed quotas.

Yet as you consider what could be called your Torean 'career' you cannot help but look up, where rising above the buildings of Grand Aekora the Way Up can be glimpsed in the far distance.  Was this truly better then the collar you had escaped by accepting conscription?  Were you not part of the problem?  And what had it earned you?

The line of sweat that runs down your nose to drip off, falling upon the laminate of your chest seems to answer that.  Nikaido had suggested a reprieve at nightfall, which had to be coming soon.  You best consider how you would beg for her mercy, that would certainly be demanded of you.

[[You may not be lost in laminate, but you're certainly making sure others end that way.->Ending]]


:: OffBaton
Your trusty baton fits well in your hand, long and dangerous-- but not long enough.  She's simply too far ahead to reach, a fact demonstrated by her making the final jump to reach the barge ahead of you.  By the time you reach the dock its already drifting out, too far for you to follow.  Once realizing she was safe your quarry turns around, waving, a smile on her face.

She almost looks familiar, but at this range your curiosity-- and Truant quota-- goes unsated.

[[Either way, Nikaido won't be happy about this.->OffEscape2]]


:: OffGun
Your lam-gun is small, but suited for just these sorts of intermediate ranges.  Sliding to a halt you pull it up, trading pinpoint accuracy with sheer volume as you squeeze off one shot, two shots, three.  The black pellets cross the distance in mere moments, one missing with a splat beside your quarry, but the other two strike against her legs.  Instantly the reactive compound expands, at first slowing the Truant then tripping her up entirely, the sticky restraint having roped between both legs.

Marching up to her, you cannot help but to smile.

[["You're under arrest."->OffWin]]
[["Nice try, slut."->OffWin]]


:: OffWin
"Please, I'm sorry, you don't need to do this!"  Her pleas are familiar, you've heard them all before.  She's still on her stomach as you approach, allowing you to place a knee firmly in her back as you deploy your cuffs.  Soon her arms are pinned behind, allowing you to activate the quick-lam's solvant, breaking its hold upon her legs.  Hauling her to her feet, you move her towards the nearby wall-- regulations demanded a thorough search of her person as the first step of detainment.

Yet as you do so she looks over her shoulder, and you finally get a good look at your Truant.  

[[You know her!->OffWin2]]


:: OffWin2
<img src="img/MEKIk40.png" width="50%" height="50%">

It's been months, but you recall her clearly-- she's the tourist who had approached you ever so briefly when you were first detained after Club Lush, the one who had sought to touch you in her curiosity.  She had paid for it with an eventual cage beside you that evening, but obviously your paths had diverged-- she was still free, and you... had become part of the system that would certainly send her to a collar for another infraction.  That fact and your identity she is clearly aware of as well, as she speaks.

"Oh my, it's you!  Please!  They will send me to auction if I'm arrested again!  You're an offworlder, right?  Me too.  Please... can't you... just let me go?  I'm making for the Way Up, I swear.  I'm leaving, you will never see me again."

Her story is much the same as your own-- a rush towards the space elevator, options narrowing as the collar tightens around her neck.  Yours had ended... like *this*, however.  Would you condemn her as well?

[[Let her go... damn the consequences.->OffLetGo]]
[[You have a job to do, arrest her.->OffArrestHer]]
[[Gag her, then arrest her.->OffGag]]


:: OffLetGo
Is it empathy?  Or merely a sense to help your fellow offworlder?  Either way, you eventually reach down, undoing her cuffs.  She turns around, clearly surprised-- yet already stepping away, as if afraid you would change your mind.  Its not an unfounded idea, Truant Officers could be fickle indeed.

"Thank you," she nevertheless says.  "From the bottom of my heart... thank you.  I won't forget this."

And with that, she departs.  You're not sure what her remembering will do for you, but you can be certain Officer Nikaido won't be happy about this.  You're going to come in under quota.

[[You make for the barracks.->OffEscape2]]


:: OffArrestHer
Ignoring her begging, you set about your work: pressing her against the wall, followed by a thorough search of her every curve.  When she continues to speak you deploy your shock baton, but the mere threat does give you blissful silence.

By the time the transport wagon arrives you have her prepped, making loading her into a cage all the easier.  As she had endured months ago, locked into a small cage with vibrating cocks lodged in cunt and ass you now repeat the procedure, damning her to a long torturous ride-- and of course a probably collar after her trial.

Torean justice, delivered by your hand-- which your superior, Officer Nikaido, notes as she steps up before you.  

[[You stand at attention.->OffArrestGood]]


:: OffGag
Pulling a bright orange ballgag fromy your belt, you deploy it with practiced efficiency, forcing it behind her teeth as you pull the straps tight.  Soon she's reduced to moaning helplessness, and you set about your work: pressing her against the wall, followed by a thorough search of her every curve.

"Well done, Officer," Nikaido nods, pleased by your straighbacked posture, legs slightly spread.  She takes advantage of the latter, running her hand up between your thighs, almost possessively.  Like most commissioned officers she mostly used your cunt as a focus for punishment, but the occasional bit of teasing seemed to indicate when she was pleased indeed.  Here she rubs a finger up against your slit, the thin laminate between her finger and your womanhood only emphasizing the sensation.

You're force to merely maintain your pose, staring ahead as she continues.  "You're proving to be quite adapt at this, I must admit.  Keep it up.  You could be free from your conscription in a decade or two, wouldn't that be grand?  Come now, Officer.  We do still have to string up your capture, teach her a little lesson, hm?"

As always you follow behind her diligently, climbing aboard the transport.  With nary a whisper the quiet vehicle begins to move, heading deeper into Grand Aekora.  In the distance you catch sight of the Way Up, so far away and growing more distant, before its eclipsed by a taller building and thus from view.

The secretary nods, your good manners noted.  She was collared too, but as far as the slave hierarchy went here on campus, students could not be lower.  With a press of a button the door to the office within is opened to you, which you rise to enter.

Passing through the portal you get your first glimpse of your assigned Headmistress, standing behind her desk.  Her dress is red, tight laminate that colelcts together in a pencil skirt that ended just below the knees.  Black frills provide ornamentation there, coordinating with her gloves and heels, and matching the feathers around her shoulders-- those being of both black and red.  It's an imposing outfit, one that is matched by her sharp expression, crimson lips pulled into a line that suggests frequent dissappointment.  She *was* an instructor, after all.

As expected of one of her high status, you're expected to greet her first.

Demonstrating your immediate submission, you spread your legs then reach down, to the hem of your skirt.  Pulling it up reveals your pale thighs, and where they meet your womanly slit.  Lacking panties the Torean custom is all the more embarrassing.
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
Yet you seem to have made the correct choice.  Noting your formality, the Headmistress replies in kind, gloved hand being lowered slowly before her.  "Down, girl," she commands, waiting for you to comply before continuing.

"Welcome to Celeste Academy.  I am sure you have already been informed, but I am your registered owner until such time as you are auctioned.  My name is Headmistress Vallis."  She takes a seat behind her own desk, but does not give you leave to take one of the chairs nearby.  Instead she merely steeples her fingers, lips pursed in thought as she looks you over.

"A bit slimmer then I had hoped," she finally seems to conclude, using one hand to draw a prim little circle in the air before her.  "Turn, let me see your silhouette.  Arch that back, show me your tits."

Strength of will even when collared is demonstrated by your stand, observing basic protocols but clearly failing to live up to Torean protocols.  The Headmistress watches intently, even smirking with a hint of amusement, but ultimately shakes her head.  "Your intentions have been noted, girl.  But we *will* break you of those.

"Very good," Vallis purrs, as you comply, turning ninety degrees before emphasizing your feminine assets.  Even so, the Headmistress clearly isn't impressed.  "A slave's diet will help a bit, but we will need to consider the Ministry of Improvements, I suspect."
(set: $Strike to it + 1)
It appears to be mostly an aside to herself however, as the Headmistress eventually leans back, repeating the movement with her hand to indicate you could face her again.  From there she continues.

Standing, she grabs a riding crop from her desk, although for the moment she merely snaps it against her palm.  "Your time here at Celeste will be consist of two portions, that which you are now in-- your general training as a slave and submissive, followed by the second-- specialized training in the role we select for you.  Celeste Academy provides training for all manner of slaves, so we utilize two metrics to place our students in the proper program."

She indicates a chart upon the wall behind her, a square divided into four quadrants.  Tapping the vertical axis, she looks to you again.  "First is that which we have discussed, your raw value.  Some of our students demonstrate a committment to their schooling and Torean culture that serves to indicate they will fetch a high base price at auction, and thus would be a good investment for the Academy to train in one of our more intensive roles.  That of soubrette, for example, or governess.  Even one of our Torean famous dolls, perhaps."

Vallis slaps the lower portion of the square.  "Other slaves do not demonstrate such value, and are best utilized in more menial roles.  Ponygirls, basic servants-- that sort of thing."

"The second metric, yes," she nods, clearly pleased with your engagement.  "A harder measure, but just as important for your placement: that of *independence*.  Many slaves believe that service simply requires submission, and while that is true in the basic sense, this does not suit all roles well.  For example: a soubrette may resemble what you Offworlders deem a mere *maid*, but the expectations upon her are much higher.  She must engage with guests, dancing along the thin line of teasing and insubordination-- in short, she must think for herself, as a slave.  The same can be said of a concubine, even if such a simple sexual object is relatively low value.  A ponygirl, meanwhile, or one of our dolls are just the opposite.  They do not think for themselves, and are not expected to."
(set: $Strike to it + 1)

The Headmistress nods, the sharp line of her bangs making the mere gesture rather aggressive.  "You will, but not for several weeks.  Until then, you will be trained in more basic matters-- on Torean culture and history, submission, and your new role within it."

She circles the desk, coming up beside you.  You both may be heeled, but she's still taller.  "Your day will begin promptly before dawn, when you will wake and clean yourself before entering one of our Wardrobes for a fresh uniform.  Makeup is *not* applied, you will do that yourself to practice.  Afterward, inspection and assignments for the day.  Morning classes will follow, which will vary.  Lunch comes precisely at noon.  Like most slaves on this planet, you will be fed slave gruel.  The taste is quite poor, I am told, but it is nutritious-- you will need only that singular meal per day.  Afternoon classes afterward.  Evenings are spent cleaning, a good thing to practice for any slave-- we do keep Celeste looking impeccable.  Before you go to bed there is also a small window for correction or, rarely, rewards.  Then bed."

The riding crop is extended before you, the thick laminate tip spun in short circles.  "We have two types of beds here, and you are allowed to choose between them.  The first is a cage, which you would be locked into each night.  For your comfort the floor is padded.  Or you may choose a bed, it is a simple cot with laminate sheets, but it does come with an additional requirement: you will be awoken an hour early, to serve at the faculty table while we have breakfast."

Others do not-- either can be acceptable, but it does change the nature of the slave."

The week comes and goes, leading to the weekend-- and the first meeting of your extracurricular group.  The *Fine Dining Team* does as was described, serving at a function the Academy put on for local leaders and nobility.  You spend the time in laminate servant's livery, setting the table, serving the meal, and on occasion teasing the guests-- they seem to delight in the occasional impish playfulness, although the danger is always there that you could push things too far, incur a punishment.

That was part of the fun though, wasn't it?

(if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth serves beside you in a matching uniform, your first experience with her since enrollment revealing your friend had changed a bit-- grown more decisive, assertive.

And use them they do, locking you into strict positions that demand pose and endurance you did not know you had-- yet tap into regardless, thriving without liberty or dignity in a way that reveals such concepts to be... stifling.

The *Charm Club* proves to be an interesting affair, your efforts largely directed towards how best to appear alluring-- and how to tease when necessary.  Its a fine line that's demonstrated most aptly by the dress they give you, a tight pink laminate shealth leaving you opened backed, a black bolero-like accoutrement atop providing a hint of class, although that effect is lessened when you're taught how best to undo the buttons and slide it from your toned frame.  Eventually it dawns on you, as you straddle another student, pinning her hands above her head as you lean in with a smile, that there was something liberating in all of this.  You've been denied anything like dignity, but with your collar comes a free pass to abandon such concerns, to give into your natural sensuality.  To truly be the slave Torei already saw you as. ]

The classroom is without a designated session for the moment, and should have been empty.  It's not.  Instead you find a group of your fellow students, divided into two lines.  The first is standing, and across from them?  The second line, kneeling submissively.

(if: $CorSlave is true)["It's a... thing they do here," Corinth explains, pushing a bit of her hair from her eyes.  It's traditional.

You're not left unattended for long.  (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth strides up confidently, hesitates only for a moment as if to give the situation proper consideration, then steps to her left-- into the line of standing students.

You must have been near the last to arrive, as soon the different pairings begin leaving-- but not before one student produces a set of laminate leashes.  Deploying one each to those standing, you join with your fellows in leashing the girl at your feet.

She's wearing the Academy's standard uniform, which means beneath her skirt she was without panties.  It's a weakness you take full advantage of, sliding your foot up between her legs until the tip of your boot finds the meeting of her legs.  There you hold, leaving her in sweet suspense for several moments before pulling back with a smile.

Below, she finally exhales.

You haven't been to the Headmistress' office since your first day, months ago.  But you've been called to her now, and find it to be much the same as you remember it.  This time however you arrive with your pet student on her leash, Pyrri, who you lock to one of the mounting points along the wall intended for just that sort of use.

Turning to the secretary-slave who manned the door, you see her already reaching for the access controls.

"She's waiting for you."

[[The door opens, you enter...->Acad5]]

You submit, but only after a moment's hesitation, a bit of a tremble in your hands.  A hand lands upon your head in response, running through your hair, soothingly even.

"Very good.  We will work on confidence, though.  I just know you *want* to show off your tight little cunt, hm?"

Leaning over, a leash is snapped to your collar.  "Now then, come on.  I was supposed to clean the west dorm this evening, but now I have *help*.  Isn't that wonderful?"

Entering the office of Headmistress Vallis your trainng thus far kicks in, pushing you to perform a well-practiced reverence.  Lifting your skirt, you present yourself while bowing at the waist-- a performance that earns the Headmistress' attentive nod.

"Presentation pose," she demands of you, another simple command you snap into.  Legs spread, hands up behind your head, back curved just right to thrust your chest and present your rear.  You could do it sleeping, at this point.

"To get the obvious worry out of the way, no, you're not in trouble," Vallis continues, indeed setting your mind at ease.  "We're here to talk about your progress so far, your valuation, and to provide an opportunity to increase it further."

[["What... sort of opportunity, Headmistress?"->Acad5A]]


:: Acad5A
"Improving yourself, by submitting to the Ministry of Improvements."  She takes the seat behind her desk, as always leaving you to stand.  "By Offworlder standards you are relatively well formed, and pleasing to the eye.  But this is Torei, and we expect *more*.  Now, whomever decides to buy you at auction will be free to make changes to you as they desire, that is their right, but that would come after purchase-- and it is usually in your best interest to seek a higher valuation before that occurs, yes?"

She looks down, where your file rests on her desk.  (if: $Value is < 1)["So far you're coming in at average value, so this opportunity may be of special interest to you."](if: $Value is > 0)["So far you're coming in above average value, so you're doing quite well already, but the opportunity will still be provided."]

She nods.  "Like the other Ministries, the Ministry of Improvements is found in most Ringdoms.  They provide a nearly endless selection of operative improvements to one's body, from something as simple as rounding out your measurements, to far more extreme procedures.  As a slave your alteration is at the whim of your owner, but in this particular instance we find it instructive for you to make the decision yourself.  Biomedical technology is Torei's greatest asset, spurred by the occasional release of new information from the AIs.  Even extreme work can be done relatively quickly."

Vallis indicates you with slow turn of her wrist, and thus her gloved hand.  "The standard program will improve your measurements, filling out your chest by another cup size, adjusting your hips and waist to be wider and more trim, respectively, and adding a bit to your lips.  We like them nice and full.  Tagging would then be performed, installing a subdermal identification chip beneath your skin-- a requirement for all Academy slaves, to ensure you can be returned to your eventual owner if you were every seperated.  (if: $Pierced is true)[You're already pierced at the nipple, otherwise that would be added as well.](else:)[And your nipples, of course.  We would have them pierced.]  Altogether?

"The advanced improvement is my personal recommendation," Vallis enthuses, for once sounding like something else besides the stern taskmistress.  "All the basic improvements are carried over, the adjustment of your measurements and nipple piercings if you need them.  Chest, hips, waist, that sort of thing.  But we do go further with this, truly seeking the Torean ideal for a slave's body.  Piercings at the tongue and clit as well, rounding out your three pleasure points-- and the subdermal chip, tagging you for any scanning device to identify as propery.  Then your gag reflex will be permanently surpressed, an annoying quirk of evolution most slaves are eventually freed from."

She taps her chin, thinking.  "I do belive that is it.  Rainbow implants would be grand, but some buyers do prefer their slaves be without them, for whatever reason, and we do not wish to harm your value.  Thus they would skipped, for now.  How does that sound?"

"Instead of a valuable alteration to your from, we will instead use this as an instructive moment.

The procedure is simple, but the Ministry of Improvements quickly proves to be popular-- it takes several days for your turn to arrive.  In that time you're kept with other slaves, some of them fellow students while others must simply be from regular Torean owners, although the gag they provide prevents any sort of questioning.  

Eventually your turn comes, a nurse in shiny laminate performing the procedure.  It's so simple, yet profound-- even if you were to somehow free yoursel from your collar, change into something beyond the laminate allowed you, any simple Torean scanner could reveal your true nature: a slave, a piece of property.

Days later, you awaken-- working your way through another confusing return to reality.  This time however you do not have mem-burn working against you, denying your recollection.  Indeed, you recall your trip to the Ministry of Improvements quite clearly.  Being stripped of your laminate, throughly examined for preexisting conditions and imperfections.  Then the operating table and a heavy laminate mask, where sleep came so blissfully...

But you're awake now, and strictly restrained.  Laminate covers you from head to toe, a sensation you're familiar enough with now to recognize, but it does take you a moment to understand why your vision is blurred-- your mask is honeycombed, the small holes providing you with limited breath and light.  There is a mirror across from you, you realize as you glance about, and it reveals... a woman it takes you a moment to recognize.  *Yourself.*  Changed, reformed in the Torean manner.

Your every curve is now fuller, your breasts quite heavy despite the corset supporting them, while your hips flared aggressively.  From the former your pierced nipples are quite evident.  Even your thighs have been altered, fuller yet maintaining a clear gap between them just below your womanhood due to your wider hips.  

Clearly-- Torean biomedical mastery met expectations!

Your every curve is now fuller, your breasts so very heavy despite the corset supporting them, while your hips flared aggressively.  From the former your pierced nipples are quite evident, and while you cannot see them you certainly feel the stud in your tongue, joined by its sister between your legs.  Even your thighs have been altered, fuller yet maintaining a clear gap between them just below your womanhood due to your wider hips.  Shifting your head reveals the final promised change, something *down your throat*.  You had thought it a phallic gag, and it is, but this one is buried so deep you should not be able to breath.  Gone is your gag-reflex, a small hole between your lips and at its tip within you allowing oxygen to pass through.  Even so, it is **incredibly** uncomfortable.

Sliding the black ball between your lips she seats it expertly beneath your teeth, ensuring it could not be forced out as she begins cinching the straps tightly.  Small locks complete the look, and Vallis soon moves on, leaving you as one of the slightly more then half of the students so firmly gagged.

(set: $Status to 4)
Your Isolation Laminate is as perfect as you had been lead to believe.  Moreso even.  The experience of wearing it, in its entirety, is beyond description.  And that was *before* the pleasure cycles had started.  You lost count of your orgasms somewhere in the twenties, and that had been hours ago when it had directed you to the bed.  Now you're utterly lost to the rapture, to its pleasure.  Sometimes the male joins you, but other times he's absent from the room.  You're not sure why.  It's not your concern.  It never should have been.

Is the absence of ecstasy a feeling?  Already you cannot imagine it, but look upon it like a nightmare, horrific and unreal.  Only the shame remains, and that grows dimmer with each sensation that emanates from your tortured, rapturous cunt.  The thought of your womanhood sends your hands downward, playing across your encapsulated breasts, down along your strictly corseted waist, to the meeting of your thighs.  You cannot enter yourself, *They* have already claimed you, but the suit rewards your promiscuity nevertheless.  Pleasure atop pleasure.  Writhing, moaning, you cum again.

She was taking to her Isolation Laminate well, just as you had imagined.  An offworlder, well traveled and curious, a story similar to your own.  Perhaps that was why you had been directed to offer the Black Card, to meet with her in this dimly lit warehouse.  To make an offer, a deal, one she had accepted.  And thus They would have another to question, to examine, to learn more of the galaxy you and she had traveled so extensively.

But motives hardly matter.  Instead you're directed to submit, and of course you do.  You would further her pleasure, quicken the transition. Thus they command. Kneeling atop the bags that served as her bed, your black laminate bodies press together and she rouses, eagerly embracing you. 

Soon you're cumming in unison with the other Daemon.

The call for you breaks the quiet contemplation of the morning, sunlight streaming in from the veranda just outside your window.  You had been shining yourself for the day, your Master's wardrobe providing an acceptable gleam-- but you always strived to look better than that.  To set an example.

Turning your head the tight choker of a collar at your neck makes itself known, reminding you of your place even when others look to you for direction-- or in fear.  The former seems to motivate the slave in the doorway.  "Governess, I'm sorry to interrupt... but the new serving girls just arrived.  Would you like them at attention, or stored for later?

[["At attention, I will address them immediately."->GovEnd4]]


:: GovEnd4
Your Master's newest purchases stand in a rough line as you stride up to meet them, three sets of eyes landing upon you immediately.  They're all Torean-born, they *know* just what you are.  A governess, a slave who directed others, who wanted nothing more then their submission and service-- and would punish freely if they failed.

Drawing up before them you give your prepared speech, a short little thing well practiced by now-- your Master owned considerable property in Aekora's rural districts, and new slaves were a common enough occurence.  You speak of their place here upon the estate, of the expectations going forward, and of your shared Master.  They seem unrefined, but you will work on that.  By the whip or your gentle touch, you've helped sculpt many slaves thus far.

When you conclude you shift them into a clean line, on their knees, then delegate their orientation to another of your sub-slaves.  You have accounts to go over, a corrective punishment to administer at noon, and of course your daily routine...

[[And the day goes on...->GovEnd5]]


:: GovEnd5
That night your new charges join with the other slaves of the estate in the backyard of the manse, where you're staked out upon the ground, four heavy steel rods linked to the cuffs that draw your limbs firmly apart.  

You've done nothing wrong, indeed your work these past months has been nothing less then exemplary, but you understand why you need to be punished-- the other slaves needed to see, on occasion, that even you could be humbled.  You are authority to them, which made such treatment all the more effective at demonstrating your collective Master's superiority over you all.

It hurts, the whipping that follows, but through the pain you nevertheless derive a good bit of pleasure, despite it all.  When your Master asks for an admission of guilt, you give it freely, writhing in your bondage as he strikes you again... it hurts so good, and you *do* deserve it, don't you?

Your client this evening is an offworlder, as many of them have proven to be.  So many came to Torei with credits to burn, and so often *you* represented the dream that had motivated them in the first place: a feminine figure in gleaming laminate to have upon their arm, to laugh at their asides, to make them stand out in the crowd, to satisfy their every desire...

Tonight that put you in a tight laminate dress, black at its center but semi-transparent along your flanks-- well considered for the charity gala you're attending, your client being the young owner of an upstart shipping consortium.  The Ringdom of Alem prominently abutted the Way Up, which explained why many of those attending were offworlders and tourists-- but that only makes you stand out all the more.  You're a statement, a demonstration of your client's Torean links and mindset.  The collar at your throat underlines that, drawing carefully concealed stares you've nevertheless been taught to identify.  They're *curious*, some even jealous as they look to the locked circlet of silvered steel and then to your client, who wears the key for it around his neck.

Other small locks decorate your body, at your back, upon your shoes.  It was all part of the game, the contract.  For the night he owned you, in every sense of the word.

[[You smile brightly, leaning in to whisper sweet nothings in his ear...->ConsortEnd4]]


:: ConsortEnd4
Hours pass, and the gala moves through stages you're now familiar with: the greetings, the toasts, the announcements, a presentation-- then the breaking up into smaller groups, mingling, where the true credits passed between hands.  Throughout you attend your client, speaking only when spoken to but doing so well, occasionally leaning in to whisper something-- practical or merely suggestive-- as the situation demanded.  

Except for the serving girls you're the only slave in attendance, it seems, and that does put you at a bit of a disadvantage-- your heels are more aggressive, your dress so very revealing, that as time ticks by you feel the fatigue building.  But you don't have a choice in how things went, and you know it.  Instead you merely refocus on your work, leaning forward to emphasize your chest as you address a seemingly impressionable young heiress, performing a Torean reverence just to get the proper rise out of a very fresh looking tourist, allowing your client to tighten your waist cincher just a bit further before he relocks it...

[[Midnight comes and goes...->ConsortEnd5]]


:: ConsortEnd5
The party is over, but your work is not yet done.  In the darkened bedroom of his suite you stand before your client as he slowly works through your locks, undoing them one by one-- but he retains the collar, as expected.  So many seemed pleased by that particular decoration.  Freed from your strictures he undresses you, pulling free your laminate and casting it aside before guiding you down upon the bed.  There *you* take the lead, even if he doesn't know it.  Adjusting positions, volunteering your mouth-- doing everything in your power to further his satisfaction.

Dawn finds you dressed again, waiting on the Torean streets for a ponygirl rickshaw to pick you up.  Returning to your owner you will finally be allowed a bit of sleep before the cycle repeats itself, another client waiting for you tonight.  You recall they had requested a more outwardly submissive outfit, which would probably mean using a laminate hood.  That's unfortunate, you've always hated how they pull on your hair.

Months later, and the stars have changed.  After so long on Torei you noticed that first.  Yerev Prime is a cosmopolitan world, a place of peace and neutrality, but you're here because it could be found the galaxy's outer rim, as near to Torei itself as one could get.  You may have left the planet but its hold upon you remains absolute, as the heavy collar around your throat attests.

As one of the half dozen ceremonial guards owned by the Eastern Trade Delegation, an alliance of Torean traders looking to deal more directly with the ships that brought Torei the imports it had come to depend upon, you're owned directy by Envoy Sharo.  She's within the Torean embassy, but you remain outside, standing at attention in the red uniform locked upon you.  

The laminate is a bit heavier then you're used to, the limited supplies of resin for the Wardrobes requiring you wear the suit assigned you for much longer periods then most Toreans would find acceptable.  To your side rests a stun baton, you're trained in its use but the Envoy kept less visible guards that would deal with any problems-- your role is to be seen, to demonstrate Torei for anyone brought to the embassy out of curiosity.

Looking out from your heavy mask, you're greeted with a small crowd, Torei being infamous enough to draw such attention.

[[You've been out here for hours already...->GuardEnd4]]


:: GuardEnd4
*"Is she really a slave?"*

*"Look at her collar!"*

*"I heard they never talk!"*

The gossip and discussion follows familiar lines, and your training demanded you ignore such talk-- although the situation does change when a young man steps from the crowd, drawing closer.  You can see it in his eyes, a certain curiosity-- and attraction.  Your suit leaves little to the imagination, after all.

He stops a step or two away, clearly conflicted.

[[Step forward.->Guard5Step]]
[[Remain in place.->Guard5Remain]]


:: Guard5Step
Protocol and training dictated you remain in place, but you are allowed one step as a warning-- or an invitation.  Taking that step clearly draws the attention of the crowd, hushed exchanges being match by the man leaning in, as if to look through the opaque glass of your helmet.  Of course, he can't.

Realizing that, he points to your arm, a simple enough gesture.  "M-May I?"

Clearly he wanted to feel your laminate.

[[Direct him.->Guard6]]


:: Guard5Remain
You remain firmly in place, the slow passage of the planet's twin suns above the sole bit of movement as reflections glide across your glossy uniform.  Soon the man seems to notice your intentions, or lackthereof, and steps forward himself.

He points to your arm, a simple enough gesture.  "M-May I?"

Clearly he wanted to feel your laminate.

[[Direct him.->Guard6]]


:: Guard6
With sudden alacrity you reach forward, seizing his hand.  The man nearly jumps out of his loose, textile-based pants-- but you hold firm, pulling him closer.  Chest to chest you tilt your helmet as you guide his hand down, where he would would never had the courage to explore: the space between your legs.  

Your suit lacks a zipper there, or any other means of access-- chastity being required of you-- but the touch alone is electric.  Even so he's disappointingly *tourist-minded* and when you finally release pulls back immediately-- blushing heavily.  You meanwhile retake your previous position, shock-pole held beside you as the crowd works through what they had just witnessed.

[[Torean hospitality, at its finest.->Guard7]]


:: Guard7
Later you stand at the ready before the Ceremonial Guard's captain, something like a governess given power over you and your sisters in service.  Legs spread, hands locked behind your back by the mag-cuffs integrated into the uniform, she's looking through your report for the day.

"Everything seems to be in order," she notes, reaching up to place her hands to either side of your head.  Once there she lifts your helmet, the lock undoing automatically at her touch-- allowing you the first breath of unregulated air in sometime.  More directly it reveals your gag, a heavy panel style anchored by the straps that encircle your head.  The offworlders had been right in that, at least-- you *were* incapable of speech.

The captain deactivates her *glass*.  "Envoy Sharo took notice of your little display, with the man today.  She authorized a few minutes of pleasure activation via your rainbow implants, but your orgasm restriction remains-- is that clear?"

When you nod she reaches down, activating the piercings and implants that allowed your sensual hotspots to be toyed with so easily.  As the captain leaves you're left to the small cell assigned you, thrusting your hips in vain as the pleasure runs through you...

Months later, you stir slowly after a long night’s sleep.  Blinking with bleary eyes, for a moment you forget where you are, *what* you are.  It’s the bell at your throat that provides the first reminder, followed shortly after by the sensation of tight restraints, all-encompassing laminate, and the view of your cage’s bars coming into focus.  

You’re Mistress Royallis’ kitten.

A black catsuit serves as the foundation for the uniform you wear daily, often for weeks at a time.  Your legs are folded up and back, heavy straps securing them there to ensure you can crawl.  More liberty is allowed to your arms, relatively, but the mittens locked onto your hands prevent any use of your fingers.  At best you can paw at things, and little more.  The corset at your waist doesn’t exactly match the feline aesthetic, but it does fit Torean expectations, and the white trim along its edges and busks does tie into the alabaster off-coloring that marks your paws, while providing a bit of color to your mask.  A bright red collar, your tail behind, and of course your customary gag completes the ensemble, the latter a heavy panel design atop a ring gag that left you capable of mewling cries only.

Lost in Laminate can be played from start to finish, but its not yet done.  I'm still working on the game, and these are my current focuses:

1) The Nun and Slave with Isabella routes are still unfinished, and will be the focus of my next round of development.  These were always intended to be shorter, but very different, approaches to the main plot-- and so expect to see familiar scenes in an entirely new light.  

2) Several of the current endings, primarily those that occur if you are placed in the Academy, could be expanded upon-- if I find myself in the mood.  The goal would be to make them more like the Truant Officer and Lush Serving Girl options, where a small scene plays afterward.

3) Bug-fixing.  Always bug fixing.

"A sort of slave all Toreans know of, but few own themselves.  She would look like a maid to you, and performs many of the same functions, but soubrettes are... mischievous by design.  They walk the line between proper deference and actions worthy of punishment very carefully, but often among a Mistress' most trusted confidants.

[[You're not the first, at least...->SlaveHub]]


:: CatExam
Sitting up you shake the last vestiges of sleep from your mind and take in your surroundings.  The cage you’re in is small, although the fact it denied you the space to stand is muted by the restraints that prevented you anyway.  It does allow you the room to turn and look about however, and you do, the bell affixed to your collar ringing softly as you do so.

Your Mistress’ mid-town estate could be described as palatial, her wealth on full display from the sheer size of the room you occupy to its gilded furnishings and sharp, modern design tones.  Your cage is in her sitting room, experience informing you that the door across from you led to the rest of the mansion, while the double-set nearest your cage entered into her personal office.  From here she conducted her business, meeting with business contacts and guests. 

You, meanwhile, served merely as her pet.

:: CatCheck
Your suit is immaculate, a fully laminate creation only Torean minds could conjure.  Designed for long term wear, you can attest to its efficacy—you’re allowed only the rarest of breaks from the uniform, usually at the monthly checkup your Mistress required of all her slaves.   Those short reminders of how you used to live, as a human capable of speech and free movement, could be difficult to endure.  After months of training, after months of service, you almost feel more naturally inclined to your uniform.  Life was certainly easier, or at the very least simple, locked into your uniform, serving as your Mistress’ pet.

It was not comfortable, of course.  The bondage that kept you crawling had been difficult to adapt to, although Royallis had taken you to the Ministry of Improvements shortly after purchase, giving you many of the Torean slave adaptions to ease some of the burden.  Still, the butt plug that anchored your laminate tail remained a constant source of teasing discomfort, and your cat food was laced with supplements to force your libido up to Torean-born levels.  Sensuality in general, and your cunt in particular, thus occupy your thoughts most of the time.  Actually stimulating yourself is impossible however, even if your catsuit has a simple zipper between your legs to provide access.  With your paws, you could never budge it.

Moving up onto your knees and paws, you press against the cage door, only to find it locked.  The lock holding it closed is on the far side, and is a simple lever that needed to be lifted and shifted to the side—you’ve seen your Mistress or other household slaves do it a thousand times—but you are utterly incapable of it.  With your paws you cannot grab anything, much less manipulate it.  You’re a pet after all, not trusted to roam freely.

It is quite embarrassing to be reminded how easy it was to lock you up, however.

You recognize the voice as much as the tone, moments before she steps into view.  Alexandra Royallis, Torean-born and raised, proprietor of Royallis Markets—Aekora’s largest chain of food markets—and your owner.  Her outfit today is of the usual sort, professional by Toreans standards, which meant laminate from her stilettos to the flared collars of the blue undershirt that provides a lick of color to the otherwise black ensemble.

Your quiet meowing, more akin to a mewl, is met with a further smile from your owner.   “I’m sure I would be just as talkative if I could sleep until mid-morning every day too, hm?  Let’s get you out of that cage.”

She reaches over, undoing the cage’s latch in mere moments—a simple display of manipulation you could no longer achieve.

“Come now, sit up pretty for Mistress, like a good kitten.”

[[Crawl out, and sit properly.->CatSit]]

Stretching up to the top of the cage, your laminate ears press through the bars as you seek her fingers.

Sitting in your haunches you tuck your paws up to each side of your chest, a manner of begging you had been trained to take when wanting something.

Your crawling out from the cage is narrated by the bell on your collar, the constant jingle announcing your every movement.  After months of being kept in such a state however you barely notice it, instead focusing on your Mistress above.  As ordered, you sit back on your haunches, kneeling before her, legs spread.  Reaching up you place your arms to each side of your chest, paws folded down in a display of total submission.  Such efforts are rewarded with Alexandra’s hand upon your head, the slick laminate of her glove sliding effortlessly against your hood as she pets you affectionately.  

“Good girl, Cici.”  Her hand drifts down, idly playing with your breast as she continues.  “I know it will disappoint you, but my schedule today is very full.  I won’t have much time, if any, to play with you.  But to make it up to you I have a surprise…”

Your crawling out from the cage is narrated by the bell on your collar, the constant jingle announcing your every movement.  After months of being kept in such a state however you barely notice it, instead focusing on your Mistress above.  She had ordered you to sit but you go further, crawling up beside her to rub your head and side against her lower leg, earning a quiet laugh from Alexandra.

“Such a little lover you are, this morning.  But I *do* need you to sit, Cici.”

As ordered, you sit back on your haunches, kneeling before her, legs spread.  Reaching up you place your arms to each side of your chest, paws folded down in a display of total submission.

[[“Mmmgh?”->CatSurprise]]


:: CatSurprise
“Wait here.”  Disappearing into her office, your position and the doors preventing you from seeing inside at the moment, she returns momentarily with a small device held before her.  Perhaps a few inches across and round in shape, a bright LED flashes green upon the top.

“A new toy,” your Mistress explains readily, setting it down before you.  When it fails to move she nudges it closer, to which it suddenly speeds away on what must be small wheels beneath.  You fight some instinctual desire to chase it immediately, as Alexandra explains.

“A toy, and a challenge, Cici.  It’s set to flee you.  Well, your collar at least.  I’ve been assured its quite difficult for a kitten to catch.  But if you do catch it before the sun sets this evening, you will earn a special treat: it will trigger your Rainbow array, and let you cum.”

Mere mention of being allowed to cum draws a quiet purr from deep within you, the training and alterations you’ve enduring having induced a near constant state of arousal in you.  It’s a reaction that draws Alexandra’s hand up to your chin, her thumb running across the slick laminate that covered your mouth.  

“I knew you would like that.”

[[“Mmmm!”->CatSurprise2]]
[[“Mmm…”->CatSurprise2]]

Pulling her hand back from your breast, she runs it once more along your head—flicking your ears playfully—before withdrawing completely.  “As I said, you have until this evening if you wish to earn the reward.  Otherwise the day is yours, Cici.  I will be in my Office, but of course your collar will restrict you to this room.  I have a meeting this afternoon, your feeding time is at noon… and I do believe that is it.”

She looks to you, a kneeling laminate kitten, as helpless as you are glossy.

Returning to your kneeling means of movement, you advance towards her, flicking your hips to shift your tail as you rub up against her leg.  Alexandra rewards your adoration with another stroke of her hand upon your head, before she steps away, crossing the floor far faster than you could ever managed bound as you are.  Passing into her office, she shuts the door behind her.

Moaning quietly into your gag, you remain in the kneeling position, looking up at your owner.  Alexandra rewards your pitiful sound with another stroke of her hand upon your head before she steps away, crossing the floor far faster than you could ever managed bound as you are.  Passing into her office, she shuts the door behind her.

 [[How will you spend your day?->CatRun]]

As your Mistress undoubtedly settles in for another day of work, you kneel at the precipice of another day spent in total laminate and bondage.  The room you find yourself in is rather large, as most are in Alexandra’s estate.  Three doors mark exits, but only one of them stands open, that which led into the rest of the mansion.  The other two, the door to your Mistress’ office and the door leading to her garden are closed, and you certainly lack the means of opening them.  

But even within your room there are a variety of things for you to do, the newest of course being the small toy Alexandra had just presented.  Your time at the Academy had demonstrated you capable of managing a bit of independence, and thus you now have it, but your time is not unlimited.  If past experience was anything to go by, you would have about eight hours to play as you wished.

Alexandra had mentioned a business meeting, but you hadn’t expected it to be with a male.  He’s tall, as many Torean-born men were, wearing laminate professional wear in the form of a well-cut vest and undershirt, the later’s sleeves rolled up.  Glancing about at the décor, he stops suddenly upon noticing you upon the floor nearby.  A firm slap on (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth’s](else:)[the soubrette’s] ass turns her around, as he speaks.

“Hold on a minute, I was not aware the Lady Royallis had a pet?”  He pats his thigh as his guide readjusts her skirts, blushing a bit.  “Come here, kitty.”

Your Mistress and the Master that had arrived earlier emerge, clearly deep in conversation.  

“I will have the documents signed and delivered to you, by protocol courier,” the man is saying, a laminate folder held casually in one hand.  “And I must say: I do look forward to the partnership.  Your markets, Mistress Royallis, will ensure my product makes it to buyers with enough left over for both of us to profit handsomely.”

Alexandra smiles brightly, as across the room (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[her soubrette] enters, taking a respectful position to the side of the door they both approach.  Waving away her slave’s assistance, your Mistress instead gestures the way forward herself.  “Allow me to walk you to the door,” she adds, “and I can assure you I too look forward to the partnership.”

You are ignored, meanwhile.  This was not the sort of conversation a pet would ever come up in.
(set: $CatCheck to 3)

:: ChaseToy
The small circular toy Alexandra had given you sits a short distance away, as if daring you to chase it.  It’s a challenge you cannot hope to resist, not least because the reward of being allowed to cum was so rarely given to you.  But knowing your Mistress it would be fiendishly difficult to capture.

The (if: $Speed is false)[green](else:)[red] LED light flashes every few seconds.

How will you start your chase?

[[Stalk it, then launch into a chase!->CatStalk1]]

:: CatExplore
The door leading to the rest of your Mistress’ estate remains open as you move towards it, crawling slowly given your restraints.  Through the open portal you can see the entrance foyer, Alexandra’s office and thus your playroom being set off to the side.  By the standards of Aekora’s nobility it’s of relatively modest size, but you are downtown, and that severely limited the space available for housing.

As soon as your feline-eared head passes the gateway however you feel a sharp shock that emanates from your collar.  Surprise as much as pain drives you back, your corset momentarily on full display as you rear up, shuffling backwards in alarm.  The shock had ended quickly, but the lingering pain is a good reminder of what your owner had mentioned, and you would do well to remember—your collar served as an invisible leash.  As a pet you’re not trusted to wander, and Alexandra did make it clear you were not to leave the room without permission.

[[At least it was a quick lesson.->CatHub]]


:: CatNap
Crossing the room on your paws and knees, you seek out a comfortable position.  Quickly you spot three potential candidates.  The first is your cage, the door still standing open.  The bottom is padded with a soft rubber, and you do always feel a bit more at calm within it—given how often you’re locked inside.  A second option is the sofa at the center of the room, the plush cushions *very* comfortable.   Your Mistress allowed you up as well.  The third and final option, meanwhile, is a spot on the floor—the hardened laminate that almost looked like wooden paneling rather uncomfortable, but with the bonus of being directly situated beneath the sunlight pouring in from the high window on the wall opposite.

[[Make your way towards your cage.->SleepCage]]
[[Make your way towards the couch.->SleepCouch]]
[[Make your way to the sunny spot on the floor.->SleepFloor]]


:: CatWindow
While three of the walls feature doorways and extensive decoration, the fourth is comparatively bare.  You’ve been with your owner long enough to know why, however, and in truth it’s a rather clever design.  If desired the wall could be turned on to reveal its purpose as a large vid-screen, capable of projecting whatever Alexandra or her guests desired.  If not engaged however, such as now, approaching it had a different effect—one you witness as the white paneling shimmers and then dissipates, dissolving into transparency.  The wall could be a *window*, running from floor to ceiling.

Your Mistress’ midtown estate was but a few minutes from the center of Grand Aekora, providing easy access to its myriad amenities while also allowing for the space she desired.  As her pet however, your main concern is that the window allowed you a glimpse out at the world beyond—one you had so recently walked yourself.

[[What do you see, kitty?->CatWindow2]]


:: CatPlay
You may have arrived on Torei with a grand goal, a plan to soon return to the stars far richer than you could have ever dreamed.  But those days are long past.  Now you find yourself seeking simpler things: the attention of your Mistress, the diversions of your toys, and of course the constant frustration focused primarily between your legs.  

Between the Torean compounds in your food that ensured a strong, Torean-like libido, the liberal use of your rainbow control package, and the constant frustrations of your bondage, Mistress Alexandra was clearly keen on keeping you constantly aroused.  Pleasuring yourself of course was strictly forbidden, but your owner rarely punished you unless caught in the act—cats so rarely followed human rules, after all.  

[[Use your paws, stroke yourself between the legs.->CatStroke]]
[[Find something to press up against!->CatPress]]
[[Actually, perhaps you shouldn’t.->CatHub]]


:: CatClean
As a catgirl, you’re rarely allowed out of your uniform.  Daily upkeep of it is entirely up to you as well, with punishments often accompanying a suit anything less than smooth and glossy.  Given your bondage you’re helped along by a small cleaning station affixed to your cage, and with the door standing open it is available to you.

(if: $Clean is true)[You’re currently gleaming already, however.  That said, can you ever be *too* clean?](else:)[Catching your toy may have been worth the effort, but it has left you with the stains of your own desire running down between your thighs.  This would be a perfect means of addressing that.]

[[Clean yourself.->CatClean2]]
[[Nevermind.->CatHub]]


:: CatTrap
The table in question is a small bistro-style endtable, placed at the side of the couch to allow those utilizing the room to set drinks or other small implements upon.  It’s decorated by an ornate red vase, undoubtedly worth a great deal of credits, but it’s the *other* thing you see up there that draws your eye.  Your position upon the floor makes it difficult to see exactly what it is, but the gleam is undeniable and you’re certain you haven’t seen something left there before.  

Are you curious enough to go for it?

[[Yes!->CatTrap2]]
[[Better Not!->CatHub]]


:: CatOutside
(if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[Your Mistress’ soubrette] had left behind that box she had entered with, and inexplicably you find yourself drawn towards it.  Honestly you cannot explain your motivations, but you find yourself crawling into the shallow bit of hardened laminate, circling several times to find just the *right* position.  Curling up, there you sit for some time, feeling perfectly content.

It appears that if the catgirl fits, she must sit?
(set: $Strike to it - 1)
[[Eventually you do find the will to move on.->CatHub]]


:: CatStalk1
Lowering yourself until your breasts press against the ground, you approach slowly, the usual jingle of the bell on your collar significantly reduced.  Anticipation builds as you slink closer and closer, your hips shimmying a bit back and forth as you prepare to spring.  Watching for movement, it finally comes just as you place a paw-mitten upon the floor.  It races off, still quite a distance away!

Your attempt at stealth has failed, it seems.

[[Run it down!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatTest1
Lowering yourself until your breasts press against the ground, you approach slowly, the usual jingle of the bell on your collar significantly reduced.  Anticipation builds as you slink closer and closer, your hips shimmying a bit back and forth as you prepare to spring.  Watching for movement, it finally comes just as you place a paw-mitten upon the floor.  It races off, still quite a distance away!

You let it go, repeating the process several times, seeking to understand its movements.  Perhaps it’s the laminate, or the bondage, or your new Torean sex drive, but it takes you awhile to understand—yet you do eventually get it.  Approach vector, stealth, none of it mattered.  The device was tracking you by your collar, after all.  You can’t surprise it, but you *can* get a momentary advantage from attacking at its side.  It would still flee and the same distance, but the small wheels beneath needed to turn to do so from that angle, giving you a tiny headstart.

It’s a lesson you would do well to remember, but eventually the feline instincts cultivated in you overcome such a rational approach—and you cannot help but chase it.

[[Run it down!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatPass1
Ignoring the precepts of stealth and stalking, you instead approach the toy directly, the bell at your collar jingly merrily.  Had it ears it would hear you coming, but even so you cannot shake the tingle of anticipation that runs down your spine in anticipation of the hunt.  Any moment now it would launch off, attempt to put distance between you and—

*There!*  Having approached from the side does give you an advantage, the wheels the toy ran on needing a short second to twist and thus drive it away from you.  That allows you a headstart, if a small one.  Put it to good use!

[[Run it down!->CatChase2]]


:: CatBehind
Ignoring the precepts of stealth and stalking, you instead approach the toy directly, the bell at your collar jingly merrily.  Had it ears it would hear you coming, but even so you cannot shake the tingle of anticipation that runs down your spine in anticipation of the hunt.  Any moment now it would launch off, attempt to put distance between you and—

*There!*  Having approached from behind does not seem to effect it, however, as the wheels beneath can run easily forward or backward.  It’s so fast!

[[Run it down!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatChaseFail
You keep after the toy, following that teasing light upon it, growling quietly behind your gag as it yet again pulls away just as you think you might be making some progress.  Eventually you’re forced to a halt, breathing heavily down on all fours, wishing your gag was removed to allow for deeper breaths.  Instead you must simply call off the pursuit, your aching limbs and burning lungs demanding it of you.  Sweat slides along beneath your laminate, but it’s the similar sensation between your legs that draws your focus.  This effort, the constant shifting of your butt plug, the shifting of your breasts with every hobbled step, was arousing you.  

Mistress Alexandra had ensured you maintained a proper slave’s sense of sensuality, which meant a near constant state of arousal, but this was quickly growing worse than that—the idea of all this effort and frustration ending without you capturing the toy, and thus your promised allowance to cum, is almost painful to consider.  Even if you must rest now, you **need** to catch that toy!
(set: $Strike to it - 1)
[[Poor kitty.->CatHub]]


:: CatChase2
The toy zips ahead of you, crossing the room at a comfortable pace—at least for a walking woman.  Bound and restrained as you are you’re pushed to your limit crawling afterward, the bell at your collar jingling loudly as you give chase.  If you’re to make any progress, you need to establish a strategy now, and stick to it.

(if: $Speed is true)[You’ve been here before, and know with its battery slowing you should be able to make up some ground if you go full speed!]

[[Set a slow pace, there has to be a trick to this.->CatSlow]]

:: CatPass
Pushing yourself as fast as you can, hobbled as you are, you chase the toy relentlessly.  Across the room, following it through the turn, then weaving around furniture—it’s a sequence you repeat several times over, never actually gaining ground.  In fact, it appears the toy is maintaining a set distance at all times from you.  Perhaps that should have been expected, if the toy could be captured simply by running directly after it there would be little challenge.

Yet sometimes the best method *is* the most simple.  You may never be able to catch the toy this way, panting heavily behind your gag, laminate-encased body aching from the effort, but you do achieve something else: the small LED atop it eventually switches from a bright green to a warning of red.  You’re running down its battery.  Even if you cannot keep this pace indefinitely, a second attempt could have far different results now.
(set: $Speed to true)
[[Still, keep up the chase!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatMed
In your pursuit of the toy you set a pressing but still relatively comfortable pace, to which the toy appears to respond in mimicry—its initially sharp speed slackens somewhat.  Even so you keep after it, crossing the room, following it through a turn, weaving around furniture to the merry sound of your collar’s bell.  If you’re making progress you cannot see it, and in fact it seems the toy is maintaining a set distance at all times, regardless of the pace you set, and you’ve seen it can move much quicker if it wanted to.

[[Still, keep up the chase!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatSlow
In your pursuit of the toy you set a slow almost languid pace, to which the toy appears to respond in mimicry—its initially sharp speed slackens considerably.  Even so you keep after it, crossing the room, following it through a turn, weaving around furniture to the merry sound of your collar’s bell.  If you’re making progress you cannot see it, and in fact it seems the toy is maintaining a set distance at all times, regardless of the pace you set, and you’ve seen it can move much quicker if it wanted to.

[[Still, keep up the chase!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatCorner
Abandoning simple pursuit tactics you instead try to outsmart the toy, dodging to its sides, attempting to cut it off as it makes each turn before running up against the far wall.  It escapes once however, then twice, three and four times… if you’re making progress you cannot see it, and in fact it seems the toy is maintaining a set distance at all times.  Were you capable of a greater speed, or if the toy was slower you could perhaps catch it, but as is your frustration only grows as it continues to elude.

In fact, it appears the toy is maintaining a set distance at all times from you.  Perhaps that should have been expected, if the toy could be captured simply by running directly after it there would be little challenge.

Yet your persistence this second time around proves its worth.  The toy is still too fast for you to ever capture directly, but you do manage to make up a bit of ground given its battery situation.  Bit by bit, you edge closer, tail flicking excitedly as your hips shimmy in anticipation.  Making up that ground again would take time, and you’re too tired for that at the moment.  This is your chance, your one chance this time, to capture it!

Ahead of you it cuts left suddenly, avoiding the wall directly ahead, and you know by now to expect another left turn in mere moments…

:: CatPounce
With a sudden burst of energy, you launch yourself forward, the black of your laminate uniform gleaming in the bright light as you pounce directly towards the toy.  You’re close enough to make a good effort at it, but it still manages to maintain its distance, speeding just ahead and beyond your paws before rocketing around the second left hand turn.

There it waits, the LED blinking as if in amusement, as you come back to your “feet”.  Setting off after it again, you nevertheless feel you’ve missed your chance this time.

[[Make it pay!->CatChaseFail]]


:: CatPRight
With a sudden burst of energy, you launch yourself forward and to the right, anticipating that the little toy could still maintain the distance it sought.  And it does, banking hard to the left to avoid you, a path that unfortunately simply drives it back towards the center of the room—where it had intended to go moments later anyway.

And it does, banking hard to the right to avoid you, a path that nearly sees it collide with the wall there.  Having cut instead of pounced however, you’re not close enough to scare it that far, and it recovers just barely—pulling another hard turn to end up back in the center of the room.

The mitts on your hands deny you any ability to use your fingers, but even paws are capable of simply landing upon the toy, holding it in place as you return to your knees, leveraging more weight upon it.  Your owner had not indicated exactly how the toy would notice it had been captured, but it apparently does, ceasing its attempts to escape after several moments.  The small indicator LED changes as well, from the red you had induced to a pulsing blue.

What comes next you only *feel*, a sensation across your body that can only be described as raw and unbridled *ecstasy*, emanating from several points at once.  Your breasts, your womanhood, your rear—points of sensuality, induced by the rainbow implants your owner required of all her slaves.  Capable of stimulating your pleasure centers directly, the Ministry of Improvement’s most popular alteration for slaves is put to immediate and extensive use.

[[“Mmmmgh!!!”->CatPass5]]


:: CatPass5
Alexandra *rarely* let you cum, a strict rule that only makes you more susceptible to your rainbow array engaging now, setting off a pleasure high you ride as best you can.  Abandoning the toy you collapse onto your side, limbs losing strength as the rapturous waves pulse through your body.  Eventually you roll onto your back, bound legs spread as your back arches, every nerve bundle acting of its own accord—furthering your pleasure.

Crying out in the throes of rapture, your gag and uniform reduce that to little more than a lengthened meow as your restrained limbs wriggle helplessly.  You’re not even fully aware of your own climax until its receding for some time, the pulses of pleasure running down your body slowing as you regain the ability to feel your sex-slickened cunt.  You’re wet, *very* wet, a bit of your own self-lubricant even escaping the zipper there to run down between your thighs.  Like any Torean kitten you pride yourself in staying clean and glossy, but as ecstasy shifts to afterglow you’re simply too exhausted to care.  What did that matter when put against the simple fact that you’ve been allowed to cum?

You remain there for some time, lounging on your back in full laminate, basking in the sweet relief allowed to you.  Eventually you do rouse however, shifting slowly onto your side, then back onto paws and knees.  Your limbs tremble for a moment, the experience having been so intense, but you steady with a bit of effort.  The trails left from your orgasm run down between your thighs, perhaps if you have the time you should clean them. Either way, your Mistress is sure to be proud of you.

:: SleepCage
Padding across the room, you return to your cage, the metal bars somehow inviting despite the loss of liberty they demanded of you.  You pass through the door easily enough, but as always settling in proves to be far more difficult.  Pressing your paws into the soft padding of the cage’s bottom you search for the most comfortable position, even circling several times before you eventually settle on one that you like.  There you shift to your side, curling up with your paws against your breasts, tail encircling your legs.

Sleep comes a bit slowly, but soon you drift into that sweet abyss.  For about an hour you remain there, coming to later with a sudden start—your cat-eared head shifting about to seek out the source of the sound.  To your embarrassment you eventually realize it’s just the bell on your collar, but that adrenaline surge does complete your waking.

As with many of Grand Aekora’s streets its relatively busy with foot traffic, women in all sorts of laminate outfits making up the majority that pass by.  Some are freewombs of course, but this neighborhood in particular featured many slaves, a result of the various manses and estates that populated the area, and the need for so many servants.  Their collars remind you of your own, although even they are allowed such simple liberties like walking.  Most are personal assistants, household servants, or couriers-- you’re a pet, below even them in the complex hierarchy of the collared that Torei supported.

:: SpecialThanks
With any project as large as this one, others have inevitably helped along the way.  So—for everyone who helped bug test, reported issues, or fixed my (at times horrible) spelling, thank you!  You’ve been incredibly helpful!  More specifically:

Big thanks to Gospodin for originating the setting!
Big thanks to Skybound for extensively testing early builds!
Big thanks to Schiggy for helping with the CSS!
Extra big thanks to all the great latex fans and models who produced the images used as inspiration for Lost in Laminate!

And a big thanks to you, the player!  Thanks for checking out my game!

:: CatWindowSky
The buildings in this neighborhood are tall, but are hardly skyscrapers, and the width of the street allows you a good view of the sky above.  Bright blue greets you, the sky above so very clear and empty.  Torei could go weeks without cloud cover, water being so valuable the AIs regulated even vapor carefully.  Nor did terrestrial vehicles flit about, as on other worlds.  Ground transport remained the primary means of travel.

But there is something else up there too, not so much floating as fixed in the sky above.  The Way Up, quite distant but still visible given its size, stretching like a thin black thread towards infinity.  You have long since stopped bothering with marking the passage of days, pets hardly needed to consider such things, but you suspect its been perhaps a year since your last fateful ride down that space elevator.  You had been a free woman, then, the world itself awaiting you.

Now you’re collared and bound, unable to walk, unable to talk, the property of another.  The small tag hanging from your collar named you Cici, while your tail and paws mark you as a catgirl, a pet.  It’s been quite the transformative experience.

:: CatWindowPress
The window is semi-polarized to those outside, but you would be quite visible now that your presence has turned down the automatic setting on your side.  Even so, as you rise up on your haunches, pressing your chest against the window as you gaze curiously at the strangers passing by, most ignore you.  You’re just one slave among the multitudes now after all, even if your situation is a bit more restrictive than most.  

You do eventually attract a passing woman’s attention however, a freewomb gauging by her lack of collar.  She squats down before the window, pressing her hand against it, as if capable of reaching through the glass to pat you gently on the head.

:: CatWindowEscape
A few rooms over a door could be found, you know that, one that would take you out onto the street you gaze upon now.  But it may have well be in orbit, for all the good that would do you.  Your collar is locked around your throat, incapable of being removed even if you had hands instead of the paws of a kitten.  It prevents you from wandering, just as it marks you so clearly as a slave.  Even without it, there are your other pieces of bondage, your feline uniform so very distinctive.  And then the tracking chip embedded beneath your skin, as most slaves were subjected to, alongside the rainbow implants that could engaged at great distance.  

Torei depended on its slaves, valued them—and worked very hard to keep the collared multitudes in line.  There is no escape.  It’s a realization that makes you a little wet.

:: CatWindowEnd
Few things hold your attention long, and the sights outside the window are no exception.  Eventually you retreat from it, crawling away back towards the center of the room as the polarization reengages—returning the window to its previous occupation of a mostly blank wall.  It may have taken a bit of your time, but indulging your curiosity never hurt, right?

:: CatWinHelp
“Mmmmmgh…!”  Your gagged mewls are unintelligible, even without the glass rendering you silent for the passerby.  Nor does your frustrated struggling seem to impart he message, in fact it manages just the opposite, the woman bringing a hand to her lips as she laughs gently at your display.

Mimicking a head pat once more she rises, returning to her path down the street.  You’re left in her wake, the laminate kitten in the window to her perspective.

:: CatWinPurr
Perfecting your purr had been a focus of the Academy’s catgirl training, and you put it to use, closing your eyes as you demonstrate the simple pleasure of being treated like the pet you are.  When you eventually open your eyes again you find the stranger amused, her lips pulled into a smile as she mimics petting you once more between the ears.  Then she rises, returning to her path along the pavement, leaving you in her wake.  

Flicking your hips back and forth, and thus your tail, you catch yourself wishing she could somehow play with you.

Wet and horny, as you always seem to be, you use your position pressed up against the window to rock your hips forward, the black laminate between your legs being presented promptly to the stranger outside.  Your desperation merely amuses her however, a hand covering her lips as she laughs softly before mimicking one more head pat before rising.  Returning to her path along the sidewalk she leave you in her wake, utterly frustrated.  Your hips flick almost of their own accord, your tail expressing your sexual distress despite a lack of audience.

:: CatStroke
Once upon a time you may have balked at the mere *idea* of attempting to pleasure yourself so publicly, but you certainly lack the dignity now.  Rolling onto your back you spread your legs, the bindings holding shin to thigh straining, but for once not impeding what you want to do.  Framing your chest, one arm to each side, you slide your paws down your own flanks, the laminate of both suit and restraining gloves all but effortless.  At the meeting of your legs you find the zipper of your catsuit, such a simple means of restricting access that you utterly lack the ability to address.  Instead, at best, you can simply rub your paws against your cunt.

[[“Mmmh…”->CatStroke2]]


:: CatPress
Casting about the room for something capable of sating you, eventually you settle upon the leg of an elegant chair set into the corner of the room.  It most certainly wasn’t intended for such use, of course, but cats rarely cared for such things.  Padding over to it, you lean back on your knees, resting your paws upon arm and seat as you position your hips just *so.*

Rounded and somewhat padded, it proves to be a good device to work your cunt against, humping desperately for stimulation.  The friction is there, somewhat, although the smooth material of your laminate catsuit renders most of your effort moot—and quickly you grow tired.  Your corset makes the effort uncomfortable, while the shifting of your hips grinds your buttplug in with every thrust.  Pleasurable, yes, but also frustratingly far from enough.

Eventually you’re forced to retreat, settled back down upon paws and knees, perhaps even *more* wet than when you had begun.  Your uniform made such efforts difficult indeed!

[[Give up, its hopeless.->CatPlayEnd]]
[[Play with yourself directly!->CatStroke]]


:: CatStroke2
It’s hardly stimulating.  Your paws and suit are so slick as to be almost frictionless, reducing the effect you manage to induce in your pussy.  Like any proper Torean kitten you’re perpetually horny, but your paws simply do not allow you achieve much—indeed it almost proves more frustrating than anything else.

And that’s *before* the shock.  Your collar, linked to sensors in your paw mitts and those of the rainbow stimulators in your womanhood, recognizes exactly what you’re trying to do.  The zap it delivers isn’t particularly painful, but it does shatter even the barest pleasure you were achieving for yourself, as a quite whine escapes your gagged mouth.  

You want to argue, it wasn’t *fair* after all, but you must simply come to terms with the fact that you’re not allowed to touch yourself.  Mistress Royallis forbid it.

[[Then I’ll find something to hump!->CatPress]]
[[It’s pointless.  Give up.->CatPlayEnd]]


:: CatPlayEnd
Somewhere deep down, you knew this was never going to work.  Your uniform ensured that as much as centuries of Torean culture and practice did, so much effort having been put into teasing and torturing slaves without allowing them the release they sought.  You need to remember that lesson: your only potential source of climax would be Mistress Alexandra.  (if: $Toy is false)[The toy she had given you seems to catch your eye at just that moment, seemingly reminding you of that fact.](else:)[Your catching of the toy she had given you had made that clear, after all.  Even now, you can still recall just how *good* that had felt.]
(set: $Strike to it - 1)
[[What’s next?->CatHub]]


:: CatClean2
Crawling back to your cage, you return to the barred enclosure, sitting down within.  A large plastic square is affixed to the side, a smooth semi-rounded surface exposed and directed into the cage itself—Torean-grade laminate shine.  By pressing your paws against it, you can then spread it across your body, a simply but effective means of keeping the material clean.  

[[Clean your head.->CleanHead]]
[[Clean your chest.->CleanChest]]
[[Clean your legs.->CleanLegs]]
[[That’s enough for now!->CleanEnd]]


:: CleanHead
Pressing a paw to the shiner, you begin ministering to your head.  The laminate that constituted your hood is as tight as any other portion of your uniform, but it was that which covered your head that dehumanized you so effectively.  With only hints of flesh around your eyes its easy to forget there is a human beneath the laminate kitten that is your uniform.  

Working top down you begin with your ears, their flexible material allowing them to be pressed down as you ensure they’re properly shined.  Your actual ears remain hidden as you progress down the sides of your head, over the bridge of your nose, then down to mouth and chin.  The heavy O-ring that kept your teeth apart is obscured by the gag panel across it, leaving you without lips to speak.  Finally there is your collar of course, the red laminate and dainty little bow attached to decoration proving far more silent then the bell, which jingles merrily as your paw brushes up against it.

[[Done!->CatClean2]]


:: CleanChest
Acquiring a fresh bit of shiner from the pad on your cage, you begin working on your torso.  Of course you cannot help but begin with your breasts, the barest hints of stimulation your paws against your chest induces frustratingly tantalizing.  Your diet ensured your curves remained well rounded out, but upon purchase Alexandra had also sent you through a round at the Ministry of Improvements, pushing your measurements to a truly Torean standard.  You’re undeniably busty now, the gloss you apply only underline that fact— as does your corset.

Progressing next to the steel-boned garment hugging your waist so tightly, you realize in that moment you hardly notice what had once been a constant impediment to your movement and breathing.  The corset is strictly tied, the lacing along your back and the busks at the front ensuring you kept measurements as appealing as they are deeply feminine.  And now, thanks to your efforts, the material positively gleams.

[[Next?->CatClean2]]


:: CleanLegs
As always, your legs prove the hardest portion to clean.  The restraints that kept you restrained, tucking your lower leg up against your thighs, also produces crevices into which dirt could hide, not to mention the inevitable effect of laminate rubbing against laminate.  Your paws are bulky too, but you persist, working slowly from your hips down.

(if: $Clean is false)[Of course you focus primarily on your inner thighs however, removing the streaks of your own desire with each pass of your paw.  The simply glossy shine of your uniform is soon returned, although somewhere along the way you find yourself lingering at the meeting of your thighs, your shine-laced paw pressing against your womanhood beneath.  A gentle shock from your collar serves to startle you out of the reverie, however.  (set: $Clean to true)](else:)[The carefully maintained gap between your thighs, a prized detail on Torean slaves, ensured your thighs generally did not get too dirty but you focus there nevertheless.  In fact you find yourself lingering at the meeting of your thighs, your shine-laced paw pressing against your womanhood beneath.  A gentle shock from your collar serves to startle you out of the reverie, however.]

You end on your feet, tucked up as they are just beneath your buttocks.  You’re one of the rare slaves on Torei not forced into constant high heel use, but that’s only because you are restricted to your knees anyway.  Instead your feet are enveloped in simple laminate booties, the bottoms of which are detailed with a pawprint design.

[[Clean!  What’s next?->CatClean2]]


:: CleanEnd
Running your paw against your own flanks to remove the last of the excess shiner, you eventually emerge from your cage a great deal cleaner.  (if: $Clean is false)[The streaks of desire that still run down your legs, from behind allow to cum, have unfortunately been missed however.]  Flicking your tail back and forth, your laminate shines all the more readily as the light from above runs across your feline form.  From knees to hips, rear to chest, paws to head you’re every movement is rendered in glorious laminate gloss.  (if: $Clean is true)[It does feel good to be clean!]

[[As it should be!->CatHub]]


:: CatTrap2
Pulling yourself up onto the couch is a struggle given your bondage, but you manage.  Eventually you place your hands upon the arm of the couch, allowing you to look over and down upon the gleaming object you had sighted from below.  It appears to be a control device of some kind, the reflection coming from its metallic luster, while rows of buttons indicate some sort of functionality.  

You dare not even *consider* it, but could this be a control mechanism for your rainbow system?  The buttons are not labeled, but the largest certainly calls to you, its bright green coloration the same color your indicator LEDs used just before dumping pleasure into your cunt and nipples!

You will need to knock the control from the table though, down onto the ground, to explore it further.

[[Knock it down.->CatTrap3]]
[[On second thought, leave it for now.->CatHub]]


:: CatTrap3
With feline indifference, you reach a laminate paw out, finding the edge of the controller.  Knocking it down requires only a twitch of your wrist, and with a quiet clatter it falls from its perch.  Success!

Unfortunately its follow moments later by the table’s other guest, the red vase you had seen from below.  Your swipe had shifted the table just enough to unbalance it, sending it to the ground with a sudden and ominous clatter.  Looking down, you see it has broken in two.
(set: $Vase to true)(set: $Strike to it - 1)
[[Oh no!  I can fix this!->CatFix]]
[[Doesn’t matter, check out your prize!->CatControl]]
[[Run away!->CatEnd]]


:: CatFix
Moving to the vase, broken in two, you recognize quickly there is little you can do.  Even without your paw mitts preventing you from picking anything up, you lack the means of repairing the vase, much less returning it to its place upon the endtable.  Batting one of the pieces in thought, you conclude you will need to leave it there.  

And you know your Mistress will not be pleased.

[[Check the fallen controller.->CatControl]]
[[There is nothing else you can do.  Leave the scene for now.->CatHub]]


:: CatControl
Moving to the fallen controller, its upside down but you manage to flip it over at the very least.  There the lines of buttons call to you, your paw unsuited for simple actions like pressing them, but you improvise: you can use your nose instead!

The only question is which to press.

[[The x-shape near the bottom.->CatX]]
[[The large rectangle along the side.->CatRec]]
[[The big green button!->CatGreen]]


:: CatEnd
Had you fur and not laminate it would have been sticking up all along your back, as you scramble away from the scene of the “crime” in a panic.  It is only when you’re across the room that you finally recognize that there is little you can do to avoid the consequences of your playing—there is nowhere to hide that vase, and you cannot leave the room anyway.  Certainly Mistress Royallis will not be pleased.

For now however there is little else you can do.

[[So, what’s next then?->CatHub]]


:: CatX
Pressing the X-shaped button does… nothing.  Hm.

[[The large rectangle along the side.->CatRec]]
[[The big green button!->CatGreen]]


:: CatRec
Pressing the large rectangular button doesn't achieve anything at all, to your disappointment.  Try another!

[[The x-shape near the bottom.->CatX]]
[[The big green button!->CatGreen]]


:: CatGreen
Pressing the large green button… causes a sudden flash of light!  Unfortunately for you, its not emanating from your rainbow system, but instead comes from the wall opposite—the large, otherwise empty one.  It’s a vidscreen, and apparently you’ve just found its remote control.  Scrambling to turn it back off, lest the sound draw attention, you’re left afterward in the silence of your own disappointment.  You haven’t found your rainbow implant’s controls, it seems, and along the way you’ve broken that vase, which you will undoubtedly be punished for.

:: CatApp
Bidden by a superior, indeed a *man*, you approach with a bit of caution.  Upon drawing close your reservations are largely cast aside as he moves to one knee, then pets you, running his hand from your ears down your back.  Repeating the process once, then twice, after the third he slaps your asscheeck with a bit of force.

“Friendly, at least.  On your back, slave.  I would see your tits and cunt.”

[[Roll over, onto your back.->CatRoll]]
[[Sit down.  No!->CatSitNo]]

Bidden by a superior, indeed a *man*, you hesitate.  He however holds no such concerns, and quickly draws  close despite your reservations.  They’re largely cast aside as he moves to one knee anyway, then pets you, running his hand from your ears down your back.  Repeating the process once, then twice, after the third he slaps your asscheeck with a bit of force.

[[Roll over, onto your back.->CatRoll]]
[[Sit down.  No!->CatSitNo]]


:: CatRoll
Feeling obliged or otherwise, you move as he requires, onto your back.  Already mostly helpless, the position leaves you largely defenseless against the man’s touch—and he indulges immediately, teasing one of your breasts as his other hand seizes the small metal tag hanging from your collar.

“Cici is her name?” he reads, shifting to pet you some more as his other hand fondles.  “Let’s see… young, looks to be in good health.  And well proportioned.  Tight waist, full bust, wide hips.  Very nice.  Are you enjoying yourself, Cici?”

[[“Mmmeow!->CatHap]]

“She’s ah, willful,” (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[the soubrette] interjects, sounding a bit embarrassed.  “You know how kittens can be.”

“I do,” the man laughs, as he reaches towards you.  Even were not bound as you are, his grip proves to be quite strong indeed.  Man-handling you would have been easy, but he’s actually quite gentle—if insistent—as he guides you onto your back.

[[Mmmgh…”->CatRoll]]


:: CatHap
“I bet you are,” he laughs.  “Good, good.  This bodes well for today, I think.  One can tell much about a woman from how she keeps her slaves, and I must admit—I am something of a cat person myself.  I keep one just like this at my place.”

He seems to be speaking to the maid standing above him, but turns his attention back to you more fully as the hand on his breast moves down, to your waist—yet teasing even further.  “Spread those legs wide and purr like a little slut if you want me to touch you down there.”

[[You want nothing else!  Obey!->CatSpread]]
[[Close your legs.  No!->CatNeh2]]

“I've found catgirls to be rarely happy,” he laughs.  “Still: good.  This bodes well for today, I think.  One can tell much about a woman from how she keeps her slaves, and I must admit—I am something of a cat person myself.  I keep one just like this at my place.”

[[You want nothing else!  Obey!->CatSpread]]
[[Close your legs.  No!->CatNeh2]]


:: CatSpread
Wet and without shame, you obey immediately.  Already your legs had been spread, but now you widen them even further, lifting your rear off the ground as you arch your back—all to offer your defenseless self to him.  Meanwhile you purr wantonly, begging for his touch between your legs.  And he gives it to you, two fingers outstretched to glide slowly across your sealed cunt.  The mere touch leaves you panting, your loins aching for more, and yet cruelly he chooses then to stand with a rueful smile.

“So very horny, aren’t you Cici?  Well I would hate to get off on the wrong foot with your Mistress by bringing you to climax without her permission hm?  Speaking of which, I *am* here to meet with her, not play with you.”

He turns to (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[the soubrette attending him].  “You may continue to lead me, slave.  But do tell: when did your Mistress acquire Cici?”

[[Try to follow him!->CatFollow]]
[[Let him go.->Event1End]]


:: CatNeh2
With narrowed eyes you resist, closing your legs to him.  Instead of disapproval however you only manage to elicit an amused smile from the man, who rises, running a hand through his hair as he regards you below.

“Naughty.  But aren’t most catgirls?  Perhaps I’ll need to speak to your Mistress about that naughtiness, hm?  Speaking of which, I *am* here to meet with her, not play with you.”

Rolling back onto your paws and knees, you attempt to follow, but their unrestrained steps are simply far too quick for you to keep up.

Taking the feed pose, you hold it as (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[the soubrette] sets your meal down before you.  Like all of your Mistress’ slaves, you’re allowed only slave feed, a viscous and aggressively bland mixture.  Yours is altered with hormonal boosters that kept your sexual drive operating at Torean levels, or what anyone from the universe beyond would call embarrassingly high.  It was hardly appetizing, but you had learned during training to appreciate every meal given.  Masters and Mistresses the world over were certainly not afraid to deny an unruly slave food.

“Let’s get that gag off,”  (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[the soubrette] continues, removing your panel gag by simply undoing the mag-snaps holding it to your head.  That reveals your lips, held into a permanent “O” by the ring-gag beneath.  And that one certainly isn’t being removed.  Cats lapped up their meals, after all.

“Dig in.”

:: CatEvent23
It had taken you some time to learn the proper technique with which to eat while ring-gagged, but by now you’re quite comfortable with it.  Lowering your head to the bowl, labeled *Cici* of course, you primarily use your tongue to lap the semi-solid gruel up.  Most slaves subsisted solely on such feed, the carefully composed recipe providing a day’s worth of nutrients, as well as your necessary liquid intake, in a form your owner at least could deem “convenient.”

Going down heavy, you can already feel that warm burn of the hormonal supplements beginning their work.  Unable to prevent your hips from shimmying just a bit, your cunt hungry for attention, you’re forced to focus solely on finishing the bowl first—further experience had taught you that eating slowly could prove liable to have your meal taken away early.

Did you *really* want to eat this all, however?  It would leave you horny, certainly, and could never be mistaken for appetizing.

Your memory may be shoddy, but you remember these at least: *glass* devices, the ubiquitous handheld alternative to more bulky computers.  Rectangular in shape, with gently rounded edges, the transparent unit lights up with lettering inside at your touch.

If you were hoping for more information on yourself, or even just an existent extranet connection, you’re sorely disappointed.  You recall that Torei largely operated outside of the galactic information network, and that was ignoring the significant delays and cost such communication demanded given the remoteness of the system.  As to the device in your hand, it appears to have been recently wiped clean.  The only non-standard file on the system appears to be a copy of “The Blagger’s Guide to Torei,” automatically installed while connected to the local network.

You don’t have the time or inclination to read what appears to be a meaty manual, but a couple topics do jump out to you:

**Torean Reproduction, or: where are all the men?!**

*We may have as yet failed to find other sentient life in the abyssal reaches of space, but variations do exist among us humans, and the planet Torei’s particular history is no exception.  One needs only walk down the street to recognize the most immediate peculiarity of the Torean people, and that is the predominance of women.  Official population counts put the male to female ration at 1-to-10, a rate achieved largely to their natural physiology.*

*Torean men are Haploid, while Torean women are Diploid.  As we do not expect the average reader to have focused all that much in biology class, in short this means that sexual intercourse between men and women always produce a female child.  In turn, if a women goes without fertilization in this manner, she will eventually give birth to a male child (over a far longer period of time, and if birth control is not utilized, which gets into biomedical topics that could fill a thousand other entries).  This also means that Torean men do not have fathers, and are instead inheriting genetically from their mother’s fathers (thus their grandfathers.)*

*Confused yet?  Bumblebees (which incidentally like most insects are not found on Torei) reproduce in a similar manner, and that hive-like structure may best explain WHY this occurs.  For that, one must look to the progenitors of Torean civilization, their eternal polar AIs…*

**Rewriting Gender, the Torean Way **

*The planet Torei is renowned for its biomedical capabilities, but of more interest for many is how that intersects with cultural tendencies towards gender.  It is true that men are generally seen more favorably planetside, if only because they are rarer, and thus more predisposed towards wealth.  One would perhaps think that imbalance leads to strict limitations on gender, but the truth is far different indeed.*

*Transitioning between genders is relatively easy (if expensive) on Torei, for offworlders one needs only reach the planet and book an appointment (or several, depending on the breadth of said transition) with the Ministry of Improvements.  Male-to-female changes are straightforward, capable of even achieving reproductive capability if Torean physiology is adopted, but prospective patients should be wary: Torean laws apply far differently towards women, and registration with the Ministry of Wombs should not be taken lightly.  Few Toreans utilize this procedure however, as male slaves are far more valuable, and free males rarely wish to relinquish any bit of their power.  Female-to-male changes are similar in cost, but the with added economic consideration that any additional value earned from joining the relatively rare ranks of men on the planet is generally offset by the cost of the procedure in the first place.*

:: GlassRing
**Ringdoms, Neither Ring-Shaped nor Kingdoms (Usually?)**

*Comparable to nation-states, Ringdoms are the foundational political unit that dominate the largely habitable ring around equatorial Torei.  Despite the name they do indeed come in all manner of shapes and sizes, along with an equally myriad variation in government types.  Kingdoms, republics, theocracies, and commonwealths, as well as everything in between run from what’s called the “Mountainous” region surrounding the singular Space Elevator, and the Antipodes, the region on the far side of the planet.

Talking in generalities about Ringdoms is always dangerous, but one can at least say that those nearest the space elevator are the most familiar in manner to offworlders and travelers.  Galactic-level amenities are common, representation with offworld trade groups can provide some manner of diplomatic protection, and local governments are generally progressive (at least by Torean standards).  In turn, the Antipodes are often fiercely traditional, with technological adoption varying widely.  

The Ringdom of Aekora, in which you now stand, is in the Mountainous region, but does not abut the space elevator directly.  It is a Diarchy, ruled by a pair of Diarchs elected to the positions.  While technically open to any Torean-born Aekoran citizen, in practice these positions have split between the richest two families in the Ringdom—the Naram-Sin, and the Sargon.*

:: Milky
Long long ago, back when humanity had only begun to spread out of its spiral arm of its home galaxy, an empire had ambitions. This empire, known only to history as “The Laminate Culture” or “The Lamination People” because of the style of clothing they produced, saw the end of expansion within the Milky Way before most of the rest of us had. Due to coincidences in the angular momentum of outer-spiral stars, they were hedged in by strong nations they had a tense yet stable peace with. They needed someplace to grow, but didn’t dare move in on any of the stars in their neighborhood.

And so an ingenious yet barmy plan was hatched to send colonists to the Andromeda galaxy. The plan was to settle those stars with Laminate Culture colonies early, and spread outward through that galaxy before anyone else had managed to start an expedition. To their credit, they thought long-term: the journey would take a thousand years, and they’d have no way of ferrying wealth from these new stars to the motherworld. This was a very very long game, and it took a special kind of desperation to even want to play it.

You can’t send a live crew on a thousand-year journey that never comes close to any stars. A generation-ship would need more fuel for life support on such a journey than it would for deceleration. The fleet they designed was effectively a big dumb intergalactic comet: machinery and gene banks and artificial intelligences wrapped in a giant geode of protective minerals and ice. Everything would just sit off and safe and inert until it came near the energy of a star again.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: OffCourse
Of course, as you can all guess now, this little spore never made it to Andromeda. Stories differ on what happened to it. Some say that the geode craft had some sort of purely analog course-correcting device that locked onto a stray stellar cluster in intergalactic space. Others say that something went wrong, and emergency systems woke to active mode and changed the ship’s course. The more fanciful tales tell of signals sent from the Milky Way to sabotage the project by changing the objectives.

Whatever the reason, the ship took a rendez-vous course that brought it to a stable orbit around the most suitable of a handful of lonely stars stuck like an island out in the nowhere between the galaxies. The light of this star melted the geode and woke up the machines, who began building factories and supply lines to construct a suitable habitat for the colony.

As I’ve mentioned before, the amount of planning that went into this project is breathtaking. The original implementors hadn’t considered their payload would get mired in this backwater, but they’d designed the construction phase to bootstrap itself even in harsh conditions. Simple machines built factories that spat out more complicated machines that built more factories to make even better machines. This process continued until at least three of the AIs in the fleet had been augmented enough to begin the next phase.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: BuildHab
Once the brains were awake, it was time to build a home for organic life. None of the planets in the cluster were likely globes, so the machines took a rocky ball on the edge of the Goldilocks zone and launched all the chunks of ice and carbonaceous chondrite they could find. If you think the timescale for the original mission was long, well the AIs had near-infinite patience. Piece by piece over tens of thousands of years, they built up a planet from dry stone into something that could support life.

Machines around the various stars in the cluster lensed starlight to knock matter out of stable orbits and off toward the new planet. I’ve been on expedition, and seen the lens devices with my own eyes. They’re impressive machines, like vast engines of war from our distant and more violent past. I’m told they still work, if the AIs ever want to use them again.

The planet’s new crust slowly cooled around the freshly molten core, and this is where the Torei we know today began. The machines set down at the two poles and dug intricate tunnels through to the hot mantle beneath, making impossibly complicated fractal corkscrew patterns. Through coriolis forces, heat, pressure and other simple physics the magma was separated out into component elements useful for generating an atmosphere.

The machines built tetrahedral “caps” of sorts atop the vents from these tunnels, and did all of the final distillation and synthesis in them. These pyramids are apparently still there inside the current-day ziggurats. The real machinery for atmospheric generation descends down into the network of tunnels, but there is a hollow space inside the zigs where the caps can be seen.

Ah, I suppose you all have the famous image of the Dahom ziggurat in the snow. Well imagine that landscape with no snow yet, because the air was too dry. Now imagine that the vast stepped pyramid is only one-twentieth the size, and smooth-sided. That’s how they got started. Those little pyramids worked tirelessly for centuries to generate an atmosphere suitable for garden crops and large mammals.

The ziggurats at Mazos and Dahom were built later, and we have hints that they were an act of desperation. We think that the AIs realized that they weren’t making enough progress on a self-sustaining biosphere. They created the zigs as habitat domes with the hopes that human workers could help speed up the project.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: FirstHumans
If that was the plan, then it worked. The first humans probably awoke inside the bottom level of one of the zigs, before they built the upper layers. They’d have had hydroponic gardens already running to give them fresh food and filtered water. There would have been some livestock, but likely no birds because the air wouldn’t have been clean enough for them yet.

Life for these first few generations was probably pretty miserable, even by what we see at the Torean poles today. The AIs were still completing their program of habitat creation, and to them the humans were little more than lab rats and plough-mares. The ziggurat was a castle of horrors full of biological experimentation and vat-grown chimeras. We think that this work resulted in tissue cultures that are still alive as membranes inside the atmosphere generators today.

This period when Torean humans lived only inside the ziggurats is somewhat hard to pin down, historically. Most of what we have is myth from the humans and propaganda from the AIs, so who knows what to believe. All we can really say is that this period marked the development of the current social system at the poles.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: Husbandry
The goal of the AIs was to make Torei habitable for normal humans, but the death rate among the early populations was too high. The bio-engineering research program produced humans who were more durable, and could withstand more of the half-made world. Specialized organisms were seeded at the equator, to try and build up biomass where the conditions were most favorable. Life on Torei began slowly to step outside, but it was all strange new breeds meant specifically for that world.

Since this was a breeding program, the human genotype was altered to produce nine females for every male. The reproductive systems and sexual drives of these humans were cranked up to unusual levels for maximal fertility. Each man would impregnate one woman per month, like clockwork. The population grew and new levels were built to make the ziggurats we know today.

Controlling such a population was not the same task as it had been before. During each pole’s summer, when the sun did not set, humans were let out onto the planet’s surface in laminate environment suits. These were an early form of today’s isolation laminates that the Emissaries wear, and they did far less. The wearer was protected from the unfinished atmosphere outside, and infosystems in the helmet kept the AI in control of what the occupant saw and heard.

What originally started as an environment suit for humans being let outside soon became a population control mechanism. A misbehaving colonist could be locked into one of these suits and made to act as an internal police force. The suits could simulate almost any sensation to the wearer’s flesh, which made it an efficient system for re-training.

The colonists’ ramped-up sex drive and lack of almost any other means of entertainment meant that the AIs had a convenient reward system. Pain is always an effective punishment, but the AIs learned how to prey on a person’s fears and desires. What we’ve seen in the present day suggests that even a limited time in the isolation suits completely changes a person. And this was important, because if the AIs were going to start actual farms on the equator, they’d need to be able to trust the farmers.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: Farmers
I’m not a geologist, but even I am stunned by the dramatic difference between the equatorial band and the rest of Torei. You can drive around in the badlands for days without seeing anything but igneous and metamorphic rocks. You joyride down dusty craters, follow fissures down tectonic thrusts, and then suddenly out of nowhere everything is covered in lichen.

If you turn in the direction of the blooms, you start to see little green shoots in the dusty cracks, here and there. Plants with long taproots extend fernlike fronds up to the daylight. And as you continue, within only a short time you find yourself on a dirt-like surface driving through low scrub. You can tell your latitude to a novel degree of accuracy simply by looking at vegetation around you. There’s a reason the planet’s flag has that green belt around the globe.

What’s also interesting is when you dig down through equatorial soil. The topsoil itself is very thin, but well-managed as a sort of sacred trust. But once you lift that off, you find caustic stuff that could make for devastating dust storms if allowed to become airborne. Early farms were planted just to control this layer of atmospheric fallout and keep it buried where it wouldn’t be a problem any more. Ask a Pembric plantation master about “leechcorn” some time, and you’ll get an amazing education in bioremediation techniques!

The farms were a success, in small part thanks to the controlled watering the equator gets. The AIs control underground aquifers via long tunnels that are off limits to most humans. When it’s time for crop watering, they engineer rain showers that bathe a portion of the equatorial region. It’s run like clockwork, and typically during the evening. You sometimes see the rain schedule next to the train timetables, for example.

At this point, the habitat creation project sadly stalled. The AIs needed the farms to supply its biotech machines with ingredients, and the humans needed the AIs to keep the rain falling and the air flowing. As one of the old poems put it (and apologies for my somewhat unskilled translation): “And the Dæmons kept dominion of the sky, and Men claimed dominion of the land.”

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: Sharecrop
Of course, the “Dæmons” kept dominion over the humans, as well. The end of expansion on Torei meant that there weren’t enough isolation suits for all of the troublemakers, but the ones that were bound in them made effective police for the rest. Well, at least for a while, anyway.

The problem with releasing an incredibly randy and fertile population to the furthest corner of a planet from your control is that your carefully controlled breeding program will go wildly off course. It didn’t take many generations for the natural-born humans at the equator to see the isolates as foreign oppressors and set plans to overthrow them. This begins what is possibly the bloodiest time in Torei’s history, which Toreologists have come to call the Sharecropping Wars.

At first, the AIs saw this population as expendable, and simply eradicated whole towns when it encountered trouble. There were usually enough people inside the ziggurats who were willing to colonize an evacuated farmstead and live out under the Torean sun. But eventually the costs of this became clear to both sides.

The exterminations and re-population efforts brought more and more humans over to the revolutionary side. Furthermore, the rebel humans had taken to destroying the crops that were destined for the ziggurats. A human colony could survive on tubers and ruminant milk for a year if they had to, but a critical missed shipment of seed oils or other organic chemical ingredients could mean trouble for the whole planet. Time and again, the humans showed the AIs that they were willing to ignore the threat of ecological disaster in pursuit of independence.

This is something that seems predictable to you or I, but the AIs genuinely seemed to have trouble accepting it. They kept up their program of recolonization for over a century before finally recognizing the equatorial ring as independent. Now the “Dæmons” became “Emissaries”, and they negotated air and water rights in exchange for necessary crops. They traded technology for the food needed to keep the population in the ziggurats alive.

From this point on, aside from the occasional nation that tested the AIs’ wrath or surrendered sovereignty to one of the Emissaries, the political role of the AIs remained in this stalemate nearly into the present day. For a thousand years, humanity was able to build its own society on the equator, and the “ringdoms” as we now call them were formed.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: FreeHuman
The politics get boring for a while here, but wars are now waged between the ringdoms more often. Alliances form, nations conquer other nations, and realms are partitioned up for heirs who then fight one another. Throughout all of this, the threat of interference by the AIs looms.

It’s not really useful as a scholarly classification, but I find it’s easiest to describe this period to people as feudal. The culture was based heavily on male inheritance of arable land, and conduct of war was often regulated by the AIs. Commonly, when a dispute between ringdoms broke out, war would be a last resort after bringing the case to an Emissary.

The art from this period often depicts the AIs as turbulent gods, bringing bounty and destruction on ineffable whims. The laws of men could be appealed to an Emissary, but the result would sometimes leave everyone suffering. Humanity wrestled with its relationship to the AIs, hating and fearing and ultimately relying on them even in independence.

For a time, a class of priestesses emerged, promising to interpret the “Dæmons” for their masters. The story goes that an Isolate raped the women of a powerful landlord, to threaten the legitimacy of any heirs. The daughters of these unions were believed to have insight into the AIs, and allegedly they were seen talking to their biological father (a difficult claim to prove, as all male Isolates effectively look the same). These women were ejected from the estate their mothers belonged to, and began prophesying in the streets on market days. Their prescience became legendary, and soon it became common for stray women to claim insight into the plans of the AIs.

This trend improved the lot of unowned women immensely over the years. Originally the term “freewomb” meant a woman whose children were not by her owner, but the word soon came to mean the children themselves. Cast out of an estate, these girls had to make their way alone in societies that did not consciously value the roles they could play. A lack of loyalties made them neutral mediators, taking over some of the roles that the Emissaries had performed before independence. But the association with Dæmon-scrying proved devastating.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: PrinceThrall
There are Toreologists who spend their whole careers studying just one period for one house of one nation during the warring states era. Land and loyalties switched around like plains rivers during a storm, but a stalemate between five remaining ringdoms held off unification for three generations. The details of this struggle make up much of the high art on Torei, and people sometimes identify culturally by which of the five empires they descend from rather than which of the current ringdoms they currently live.

There was a courtesan named Theca or Nebla (depending on the language of the tale), and the emperor of Falon made a grand present of her to the emperor of Prellatia. This gift was part of a court gesture of great magnitude, but war demanded the Falonian emperor’s attention at the home front. So he locked her into Falon’s symbols of state (scepter, crown, and boots) and sent her along with an escort formed of his most trusted palace guards. He would be present in a ceremonial sense, and would arrive in person later to wear the diadem once more.

By the time Theca reached Prellatia, the war in Falon had claimed the lives of the four emperors. The Prellatian emperor gloated, and tried to take the crown from Theca’s head. Her guards dispatched this ruler expertly, and in a legendary battle managed to hold the Prellatian palace.

There were further battles, but within a year all of the noble houses on Torei were swayed by Theca’s calls for peace. She was but a slave, yet she wore the Falonian and Prellation crowns. She seduced hundreds of powerful men who came to her court, and each man felt he owned a piece of her. The planet was tired of war, and Theca offered a new model for human self-rule.

In a coronation ceremony that is the subject of all the great murals and hangings on Torei, she bound herself with circlets made from the crowns of the five empires: one on each ankle, one on each wrist, and Falon’s about her throat. The remaining symbols of state were made into a multi-colored chain that kept her locked to the throne for the rest of her life. Torei now knew life without war for the first time since it had settled the equator.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: PolarRelations
With the ringdoms no longer fractured, the need for Emissary intervention or alliances with the poles almost vanished overnight. People worried what the Dæmons would do at first, but soon forgot their fears: the rains kept coming on schedule and no waves of slick black bodies descended on their habitations.

The polar AIs, for their part, seemed to enjoy this era of peace. Without war to sap resources, the cost of equatorial goods went down. They exported fewer engines of war and more agricultural and lifestyle goods. The peace dividend seemed to pay out to everyone.

Unfortunately, the freewombs on the streets suffered terribly. With a culture no longer nervous about the mood of the polar Dæmons, they soon found themselves scapegoats for all kinds of problems. During the Princess Thrall’s rule, the ruling houses enacted hundreds of strict laws governing their lives. Many sought enslavement in poor houses to escape persecution, but most soldiered on in the oppressive regime.

After the death of the Princess Thrall, the Council of Regents continued to meet and honor the peace for some time. One woman would be offered up from each of the original five empires per year, and chained to the throne as a group. Many of the festival queens you see today are inspired by this tradition.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: Dissolution
With human society stable and peaceful, it was only a matter of time before revolutionary thinking cropped up again. This time it was more of a nationalist flavor. In the time since the wars, local cultures had a chance to flourish. Language was largely uniform thanks to the AIs’ influence on communication, but customs and traditions gave people a national identity that they wanted to see reflected.

Over the next two centuries, local independence movements chipped away at the authority of the Council of Regents. Some set up their own copies of the Council, claiming authority over all of Torei. Some brought in polar Emissaries and boasted that they’d bring back the heroic age that had settled their land. In all, the Regents were as tone-deaf as the AIs had been, and they responded to uprisings with brutality.

Once the dust settled, the rough borders of modern Torei were laid down. One can look at a map of Torei from three hundred years ago and still identify almost all of the nations based on a modern atlas. Unity was gone, but trade struggles replaced war as the means for jockeying among the ringdoms. The AIs had become experts at the use of political economy to control the human settlements, as the ringdoms weren’t so eager to sacrifice quality of life once they’d re-gained stability.

And who knows where Torei would have gone if this had been allowed to continue?

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]


:: Discvoer
All the guidebooks tell you, Cmdr. Stave Fedman was the first human from mainstream intergalactic civilization to visit Torei. While it’s true that he was the first to join Torei and the rest of humanity in contact, there is ample evidence that others discovered Torei’s stars long before this.

We have records of a pirate fleet from the early days of Andromedan colonization. The logs hint of a “cache of starrs(sic)” where their plundered booty could be staged far from intergalactic jump points. Some micro-asteroids found around other stars in Torei’s cluster are believed to be wreckage from an orbital battle, but little conclusive evidence has been collected.

The AIs themselves have marked certain ravines and cave systems on Torei as off-limits to humanity. Some of the more creative analysis of long-range reconnaissance hints at a structure shaped rather like the hull of a long-space frigate of the sort used five thousand years ago. It’s sketchy at best, but it’s at least somewhat corroborated by faint burn marks on the surface rock when the regolith layer is cleared by wind.

At any rate, Torean humans themselves had no contact with the outside world until Commander Fedman’s expedition. Torei’s cluster had been known since regular passage to Andromeda had opened up, but the cost of visiting it hadn’t been justifiable. Once the cost of habitable land in the Milky Way had climbed back up and the technology for space travel had advanced enough, it was only a matter of time before someone visited each little isolated star out in intergalactic space hoping for a homestead.

Fedman’s diaries were cleaned up for the official record, but at least three versions claiming to be the originals can be found in bookshops all over Torei. Each one tells a slightly different tale of the debauchery and revelling he engaged in on his visit, but they’re all really based on interviews with his crew.

[[Return to the index.->Guide]]

The ringdoms built landing pads to attract visiting ships, but all of the orbital infrastructure was controlled by the AIs. Voidcraft would stay in a solar orbit for ages before being permitted to even approach a Torean orbit. The AIs vetted and quarantined visitors fastidiously. When a ship was allowed to the surface, the humans paid top prices for any cargo aboard.

At first, the humans bartered: the AIs had spent tens of thousands of years perfecting genetic manipulation and biotechnology as part of the habitat creation project, and Torei had the capacity for medical services unavailable anywhere else in the cosmos. Eventually all of the nations were able to trade in common currency, and word started to get out that they paid handsomely for certain cargoes.

A flotilla of rough trading ships sat idle in orbit of Torei’s star, each waiting for permission from the Dæmon Dockmasters to land. From time to time a chaff-runner would make an attempt at unauthorized landing, and some would succeed. The AIs dutifully broadcast the registration IDs of all impounded vessels, and there are some downright chilling recordings from the captured pilots who claimed to have “defected” to Dahom or Mazos.

In retrospect it’s obvious why the AIs were so picky, but at the time they seemed as mysterious to us as they did to the Torean humans. The AIs were still pulling the strings of the human economy, and wanted a surplus in goods needed at the ziggurats and a defecit of items needed at the equator. So generally a lot of food and water and hydrocarbon mixtures made it through, while processed goods and technology stayed in orbit.

Unfortunately for the AIs, it was the manufacturers of technology and processed goods that had the strongest space forces. The Zanweg Cartel sent an armada directly into Torean geosynchronous orbit and began to lower a tether to the peak of the highest mountain on Torei’s equator. With fighter escorts running interference swarm patterns around the tether, a full-scale orbital lift was built along it’s length.

The space elevator on Torei changed everything. The mountain it was built on was not very high, but it never had a chance to build up any soil layer of note. It had been disputed territory for centuries, and several ringdoms that abutted it considered it a national treasure. Once the base anchor port was completed, the borders were formalized and the tower was declared a neutral intergalactic trade zone, and all ringdoms on that side of the planet were granted access corridors to the base.

Once trade in industrial goods opened up, the neighboring ringdoms were able to build vast tower arcologies around the planetside port spire. The more wealthy nations were able to build skybridges to the orbital lift tower from the tops of their own structures. It’s a common for a vast city to spring up around one of these, but Torei has over a dozen!

I said this was unfortunate for the AIs, and it really was. The economy has swung out of their control, and the habitat-creation project is seriously compromised by this. If the planet never becomes self-sustaining, they may resort to force once more. It remains to be seen how well Mazos and Dahom adapt to this new reality. They’ve been slow to change before, probably because a biosphere-building project requires a very patient long-term mindset, and they seem to treat the human economy as yet another ecological system.

:: Future
The ringdoms seem to be doing a brisk business in sex tourism, tax havens, and basic medical services. The AIs could outclass them on the last one, if they ever decided to. Of course, it could lead to their biotech secrets getting out, which would ruin any advantage they have.

The AIs have always held control over the badlands, but they appear to be stepping up their game lately. Word is that they’re losing population and have to spend more and more of their resources sending Emissaries further and further afield. The unrest at the poles is helped by agitator-liberator groups that run a sort of underground railroad to help people flee to the ringdoms.

One of the reasons the AIs are stretched thin is that they’ve begun to maintain a space fleet. It’s a rag-tag collection of used and commandeered vessels, but they’ve been spotted at ports in three galaxies. They may be trying to export their services, and they seem to buy exactly the same things they’ve always needed.

And of course Torean expansion to other stars was always part of their mandate. The Dockmaster is largely silent, and only issues quarantine orders from time to time. It could be busy managing the polar fleets and preparing for conquest. We just have no way of knowing.

Lapping up the final chunks of your slave feed, you then quickly run your tongue along the edge, ensuring you sucked down every last bit.  Only then would the soubrette above you be pleased, after all, and if she was not she most *certainly* would make sure your Mistress was aware.  

She glances pointedly down once you finally inch away, but appears satisfied.  “Very good, Cici!”

You feel full, and worse—or perhaps better—increasingly *aroused*.  It wasn’t the same as your buttplug could induce, or a hand between your legs.  That was sweet and simple, the source clear, the build towards climax easily charted.  This is something else,  something harder to define.  A background sensation you could not shake, a whisper just out of earshot that promised your every carnal delight.  Bound and gagged, collared and locked into tight laminate, your daily meal ensured you thought of little else besides your cunt.

[[Moan lewdly.->CatMM]]
[[Show your appreciation, lick her boots.->CatBoot]]

Almost as soon as you lift your head to move away, you feel a heeled boot plant itself firmly on the back of your head, forcing it down again.  From above, (if: $CorSlave is true)[Corinth](else:)[the soubrette] clucks her tongue.

“Oh no, Cici, you will *finish* your food like a good kitten.  Mistress would be most saddened if you went to bed hungry, hmm?”  To guarantee that, the boot remains firmly in place.

It takes you a moment, a *long* moment, to recognize the raven-haired woman who strides confidently through the door.  Even then you cannot bring yourself to believe it, not until the secretarial slave asks her name, and she responds.

“Corinth Sylvette.”

The last few months at the Academy had seen you transformed, adapting to your new role upon Torei, and the same seems true for Corinth—in a most spectacular fashion.  Your memories may still be less than whole, but the woman who approaches your cage after signing off with the secretary very much looks the part of a Torean Mistress, with little of the Corinth you remember.  Tall knee high stiletto heels add an imperious snap to every step she takes, while the laminate one piece she wore seemed to demand attention, even if the long coat of a similar midnight color kept her dignity. Even her crimson-painted lips seem to dictate, not merely speak the word that emerges as greeting.

“Hey.”  It hangs in the air between you, filling further and further with your apprehension.  Yet then she smiles, relaxing just a bit, and there the Corinth you remember spills out from the mask of the steely Mistress.  Not a disguise, you conclude, but a new Corinth.  Lost and reveling in the wonders of Torei.

“Try not to stare *too* much,” she teases, still holding that smile.  “And get on your knees,  uh, *slave*.”

[[“You look so different!"->CorEnd4Oops]]
[[“…yes, Mistress.”->CorEnd4]]


:: CorEnd4Oops
The smoky makeup around her eyes makes the shifting of her brows, furrowing a bit in legitimate displeasure, all the more obvious.  “There will be time to talk, but you must remember your place.  *On your knees.*”

She does not sound liable to ask nicely again.

[[“…yes, Mistress.”->CorEnd4]]


:: CorEnd4
Moving to your knees, spreading your legs and bowing your head as you had been taught, Corinth opens the cell door.  She seems even taller as she stands above you, brushing a bit of your hair away from your shoulders.  Reaching to her purse she produces a black circlet of what your furtitive glances first presume to be laminate, but the weight with which she handles it suggests a steel core at the very least.  You realize the intention immediately.  A collar.  *Your* new collar.

(if: $CorOverride is true)[“Seems our little plan went perfectly,](else:)[“I just knew you would be listed for auction eventually,]” she asserts.  “Even so… it is a bit hard to believe this is where we are, huh?  I certainly never thought I would cash out from our, well former, employer.  Stay on Torei.  But… mhm, I did, didn’t I?”

She lowers the collar, lining it up with your throat as much as allowing you to examine it closer.  It is indeed coated in a thin aesthetic layer of laminate, yet with careful engraving that allowed the silver of the steel beneath to shine through, spelling out a short statement: *Property of Mistress Sylvette.*

“Ready to enter my service?”

[[“Yes, Mistress.”->CorEnd5A]]
[[“Of course!”->CorEnd5B]]


:: CorEnd5A
“So formal,” she teases.  “But that’s good.  Your auction price had a slight premium for being Academy-trained, after all.” 

Pressing the collar forward, it comes up against your throat, momentarily cold before your own body heat seeps through laminate and steel alike.  With a quiet, but so very final feeling **click** the hidden mag-lock behind engages and Corinth can pull away.  Your collar remains, its tight embrace providing an eternal reminder of your place on Torei now.  That of a slave, owned by the Mistress above you.

To the collar a short length of chain is then attached, a leash, which Corinth tugs to bring you to your feet.  “Let’s get out of here, yeah?  We don’t need to hurry, but we also shouldn’t just waste time hanging about the market.  I setup dinner reservations for us, to celebrate the new… relationship, between us.  But before that we have to make your appointment, at the Ministry of Improvements.”

Already she’s pulling you along, into the warren of hallways that made up the Prime Market’s slave pens.  “We can talk things over at dinner.”

[[“My appointment… at the Ministry of Improvements?”->CorEndMin]]
[[“Yes, Mistress.”->CorEnd6]]

“So enthusiastic,” she teases.  “But that’s good.  Your auction price had a slight premium for being Academy-trained, after all.”

[[“My appointment… at the Ministry of Improvements?”->CorEndMin]]
[[“Yes, Mistress.”->CorEnd6]]


:: CorEndMin
“Yeah, of course!”  Corinth replies.  “It’s almost a tradition on Torei, you know, to make such an appointment after buying a slave from auction or wherever.  There are so many ways to improve a slave, and the Ministry is so inexpensive for many procedures so it just makes sense, you know?  Nothing too dramatic, so no need to worry.  Just going to fill out your measurements a bit, bust and hips, thighs too.  Have your tracking chip updated with my credentials, a set of rainbow controls, adjust your gag reflex… hm, ah!  The most important part!”

Looking over her shoulder, she winks.  “I have a thing for red-heads, so… get ready for *that.*”

[[“You’re… really serious about this…”->CorEndSer]]
[[“I understand, Mistress.”->CorEnd6]]


:: CorEnd6
“Great!”  Your Mistress enthuses, leading you onward.  “Let’s get to it, yeah?”

It’s rhetorical, you lost your right to decide months back after all.  And much like your time at the Academy the next few hours pass quickly, even if you’re rendered unconscious for some of them.  The Ministry of Improvements, your submission to the waiting Lancers there… it all passes in a blur.

[[Your collar remains, however.  Always there, tight and unyielding.->CorEnd7]]


:: CorEndSer
She stops, turning around to all but loom over you.  Reaching up, she brushes the hair of her bangs from her eyes to stare into yours all the more readily.  “I am serious about this.  If Torei is to be my-- *our* home, I must be.  You should know better than most how easily it is for a freewomb to find herself in a collar, hm?”

She runs a fingernail along yours, smiling.  “Luckily you’re in mine.”

“Hey—babe, did you hear me?”

You snap back to reality with a bit of a start, recalling where you are.  Club Lush, at one of the private tables in the VIP section above the general dance floor.  Corinth’s dinner date, as planned, your visit to the Ministry of Improvements already completed.  

Glancing down, you take in the dress Corinth had picked for you—a long laminate ensemble matched with gloves and heels.  Laminate thinwear even provided for your sheer stockings.  Of course your collar remained as well, as tight as ever, but she had accessorized it as well by utilizing the hardpoints on the side for a set of short laminate straps.  It may be absent for the time, but affixing a gag of some sort would take only moments.

“I was saying you may drop protocol,” your date, and owner, explains over a charming smile from her seat across the table.  She too had utilized a wardrobe, acquiring a corset.  Her coat remained as well, but was seated on the curve of the small booth between you both.  “You may ask any question you like.  I’m sure you have plenty.”

"Well," Corinth begins, “(if: $CorOverride is true)[I had our plan, of course.  But you had the easy part, once you began your path you stopped having to make choices.](else:)[I knew I just couldn’t leave you on this planet.  So once you left, I took matters into my own hands.]  I had to figure out how to, you know, survive on this planet.  Beyond a few days tourism.  Couldn’t continue working as we had been, after all, so I cashed out.  That bought me time, but a freewomb on Torei need to take precautions, right?  So I did.  I’m a liaison now, for Expedition Torei.  It’s an offworlder firm, obviously given the name, that provides guided experiences for tourists a bit wary of the… let us call it “unbridled” Torean experience.  That’s how I make my credits, and how I could afford you.”

“You are my slave,” she agrees, pointedly staring at your collar before turning the question around back at you.  “What do you *think* that means?”

[[“That you can free me now, you have that right!”->CorAskFree]]
[[“That I’m your property.”->CorAskProp]]
(if: $CorOverride is true)[[[“That we can be together, as we talked about.”->CorAskTogether]]](else:)[[["That we can be together, as... partners."->CorAskTogether]]]

“I have.”  There is no reservation in her response, no hesitation.  “Once we talked and decided that we would be trying to make our home here, I made it a priority.  But actually *living* it, everyday while you were at the Academy… I’ve come to realize just how liberating this planet is, babe.  You don’t need to hide your desires here.  The universe is big, real big, but this planet is unique that way.”

(if: $Strike is 0)[The bowl that holds your meal is hardened laminate, semi-transparent and quite well suited to Club Lush’s aesthetic.  Of the meal itself however, compliments are harder to find.

Your Mistress takes a sip of her drink, a bright infusion of blue that reflects brightly off the laminate covering her chest.  She seems to notice where your gaze had fallen, grinning as she nods. 

“Ask away.”

“Oh, so you *noticed*,” Corinth laughs, a hand to her chest.  “Right, well.  Part of that is my work.  Offworlders come down the Way Up knowing little, but they have expectations.  My looking the part of a proper Mistress helps sell the experience.  And you know the saying: dress for success, right?  Truant Officers and other bothersome people here don’t often bother someone who looks one,” she counts off her finger, “Torean and two, like she means business.”

That last line is delivered with sudden fearsomeness, your widened eyes earning a second laugh from the Mistress.  “And, you know, there was you to consider.  If I was going to make a serious attempt to go after you, to do this… whole thing, I felt I had to earn the *right* to own a slave.  Look the part, be the part, that sort of thing.”

She leans over the table, biting her bottom lip.  “Do you like it?”

“It’s not proper to talk specifics with a slave about their auction,” Corinth notes, sounding very much like a Torean traditionalist in that moment.  “You weren’t… terribly expensive, I will say.  One of those Academy Dolls, or a proper fully certified soubrette, those can break a bank.  Otherwise its not out of reach for most who live on this planet to own at least one slave, there are just so many collared girls—and the occasional man, available.”

She shrugs.  “Point is, I got the one I wanted.  And your time at the Academy ensures you’re useful to me immediately, if we’re looking at it from a less… romantic view.  In a few years I hope to own at least a half dozen collared girls.”

Corinth nods.  “Oh yeah.  Nothing impressive mind you, but it’s a nice enough apartment I suppose.  Decided to stay in Aekora because you would be auctioned here, but also its just cheaper than the Ringdoms right up against the Way Up.”

Swirling her drink a bit, she takes a sip before continuing.  “It came with all the peculiar Torean bits too.  You know, d-rings and hardpoints around the bed frame, suspension fittings on some parts of the ceiling…” she winks.  “The fun stuff.”

Her smile this time is simple.  Sincere.  “Thank you.  Torean standards for a woman’s looks are very high, as I’m sure you’re aware.

You look down, to the expanse of red laminate that constituted your dress for the evening.  The material is as glossy and tight as any other you’ve worn upon Torei, but it’s the way you fill it out that feels so remarkably different.  

The Ministry of Improvements had made several changes to you, adding to the work done during your time at the Academy, as requested by your so newly established Mistress.  You had been a bit on the lean side upon arriving on Torei, months ago, but now your curves press against the laminate readily.  At chest and hips your measurements have been adjusted towards the bountiful norm that Torei—and most men you had ever met—seemed to prefer.  Even without a corset your waist presents a nicely tapered look as well, only adding to the effect.  

It’s harder to observe, but a glance towards any mirror would reveal your hair to be a bright and insistent red now—the color as bold as it is now natural, the Ministry’s work going further then simply dyes.  Below the neck you’ve been denuded of hair, although that matched galactic sensibilities as much as Torean ones.  

Yet its something *else* that had drawn your attention downward in the first place, a trembling sensation of… aching desire, far stronger than you had ever known, between your legs.  You’re dressed in laminate, collared at the throat, but you should not be *this* horny.

Across the table, Corinth tips her head curiously.  “Problem?”

[[“N-No, Mistress…”->CorAANo]]
[[“I’m… wet, Mistress.”->CorAAYes]]


:: CorGlasses
“Huh?”  The momentary confusion passes as Corinth plucks the black-rimmed pair from her nose, examining them.  “Ah!  Well, helps sell the look.  Torean Mistress, and whatnot.  But they’re actually quite useful, it turns out.  My set here has a projected HUD, allows me to monitor things… I used it to great effect at the auction, obviously.”

She replaces them upon her face, and you do indeed notice a holographic glint over the lenses now that you’re looking for it.

(if: $CorOverride is true)[But that’s not what we agreed, before you went to the Academy, is it?](else:)[But I wouldn’t be doing that.]  You’re a collared slave, I paid good credits for you.  And I intend to make it here, on Torei.  In the Torean fashion.  Freeing you would accomplish little, besides my losing out on credits and you being dumped out on the streets again.  You’ve already demonstrated you’re not… all that great at being a freewomb, hm?”

She doesn’t sound angry, or mocking, but simply takes a firm expression.  Given her makeover, the black hair and crimson lips do much to strip any arguments from your tongue.  Your time at the Academy provides the rest, the training they had drilled into you shining through.  

“So, now that we have that established, what does your collar *mean*?”  Corinth asks again.

[[“That I’m your property.”->CorAskProp]]

“That’s exactly right, babe.  You need to remember that, going forward.  I know we were friends, and we still are, but that collar you’re wearing… it changes everything.  From a Torean perspective, certainly.  But I intend it to mean the same between us.  You will observe slave protocol, and I will be your Mistress.”

She smiles at that last word, clearly enjoying the title.  Even so, her lips purse together afterward, as she looks to you even more intently.  “But we never established what exactly our… relationship is, have we?  (if: $CorOverride is true)[We talked about my owning you, of course.  But not the specifics.](else:)[By the time I decided to attempt to buy you, you were already enslaved to the Academy.  We never got to address specifics.]  We should do that now.  If we’re starting a new life here *together*, after all.  As Torean Mistress and slave.  How… do you see things between us?”

The question seems deeply important to her.

“Be together,” Corinth says, repeating your words.  She seems to mull them over, chewing on each syllable.  “We never really discussed what that would *mean*.  For us, I mean.  The relationship.  I’ve had a lot of time to think about it, though.  Since you went away to the Academy, I mean.  Which we will get to in a second.”

Placing both hands upon the table between you, she smiles brightly, yet her eyes are intense—domineering even.  “Before we do, you need to tell me what you are.  You need to say.”

Corinth’s lips pull together tightly, her eyebrows rising with a hint of surprise and consternation.  “Well… that’s understandable, I suppose.”

Her disappointment fades, replaced by a look you had often seen from the Academy’s Headmistress—generally right before you were told to do something, regardless of your thoughts on the matter.

“I’ll treat you as my slave, going forward.  As simply as that.  You were trained at the Academy in the role of a generic concubine, and that will fit my needs perfectly.  I intend to use you as my sex slave, after all.”

The way she says it, so nonchalantly, is perhaps the best indicator that Corinth had truly adapted to Torei’s culture.  You’re in public, the occasional patron of Club Lush walking by, but she does nothing to lower her voice, or obscure her intentions.  Corinth had always worn her feelings on her shoulder, and she wasn’t about to stop now.

[[…sex slave?”->CorSex]]
[[“What do you expect of me, then?->CorExpect]]
[[“What will my duties be?”->CorDuties]]


:: CorALove
Corinth smiles, unabashedly.  “I *knew* it.  Even before you started coming to Torei, when we worked together… but I never had the confidence to ever be direct about it, you know?  Staying here on Torei, working to become a Mistress certainly changed that at least!  And now I *own* you.”

The mere thought seems to enthuse her, almost to the point of giggling from sheer pleasure.  But she retains control of herself, brushing a bit of hair from her eyes as she reasserts herself.

“If that’s how you feel, I think you will like what I had planned.  I’ll treat you as my slave, going forward.  As simply as that.  You were trained at the Academy in the role of a generic concubine, and that will fit my needs perfectly.  I intend to use you as my sex slave, after all.”

[[“What do you expect of me, then?->CorExpect]]
[[“What will my duties be?”->CorDuties]]


:: CorExpect
“Expectations, right, yes.”  Collecting herself, Corinth quickly demonstrates she had given the matter considerable prior thought.  “You’re a slave now and will be treated as and kept in the traditional Torean manner.  I expect you to be submissive and dutiful, always minding your manners.  You must recognize that you are now property.  *My* property.  I intend to keep you bound in most circumstances, and of course you will be wearing laminate only going forward.  Textiles are far too expensive to import, and I very much like the way you wear it.”

She pauses to take a sip of her drink but isn’t done yet.  “I will be watching you closely and correcting you if the need arises.  I don’t intend to be harsh, but I will strive to be strict with you.”

[[“What will my duties be?”->CorDuties]]
[[“I… understand, everything I mean.”->CorAskBr]]


:: CorDuties
“First and foremost, you will keep yourself presentable, as befits a concubine.  On days that I am working, you will generally remain at our home.  Until I acquire a maid those duties will be your own, and I expect things to be tidy when I return home.  Most evenings… I will play with you, most certainly.  Or take you out to a Club, or event.  Whatever I fancy.  And as for nights…”

She grins, predatory.  “You are a sex slave, after all.”

[[“What do you expect of me, then?->CorExpect]]
[[“I… understand, everything I mean.”->CorAskBr]]


:: CorSex
“Concubine is the ‘proper’ term,” Corinth replies, even raising her hands to mimic quotation marks upon the word ‘proper’.  “But… yeah.  Torei has a long history of girls like you.  It would make more sense, financially, to put you to work—but having a concubine is a prestige thing.  So you will be attending me to social events… like this Club, and I’ve prepared a set of restraints for you to wear to bed—ah!  But I’m getting ahead of myself, aren’t I!”

She laughs openly.

[[“What do you expect of me, then?->CorExpect]]
[[“What will my duties be?”->CorDuties]]

“Good.”  Corinth enthuses, clasping her hands together before her.  “You always were adaptable, and the Academy ensures you are quite literally trained for this."

[[“Can I ask about something else, Mistress?”->CorDate]]


:: CorAANo
“I *did* say you weren’t under normal protocols, so I won’t punish you for lying to me… but you are lying, aren’t you?”  If you expected a reprimand, what follows is a surprise.  “You shouldn’t do that, not with me.  It is important for our relationship that you always be open with me, alright?  No secrets between us.”

Corinth leans in a bit.  “So, come on.  What’s bothering you?”

[[“I’m… wet, Mistress.”->CorAAYes]]


:: CorAAYes
“Oh?”  Corinth’s smile is radiant, her raven hair framing the grin.  “I would hope so, I spent good credits at the Ministry to ensure you generally are.  But… they did warn you might not remember some of what we talked about, before you went to the Lancers.  I’m assuming that’s the case?”

Months later, the crack of the whip pulls your eyes open suddenly.  The command is made apparent, even if it goes unspoken.  To your left and behind the sound of chains and straining straps announce your team rousing, and you join with them.  From your kneeling position of rest you return to your feet, a difficult maneuver given your bondage but you’re well practiced by now.

Your uniform is red and black laminate, the harness locked across your body the former, boots and armbinder the latter.  A garter belt at your waist nevertheless exposes your womanhood, ponies were kept in such a manner as per regulations, but it does at least hook to the stockings that emerge from your boots.  *Those* are your most undoubtedly Torean feature, the knee high pieces of equipment adding a full foot to your height.  Steel hooves nailed to the bottom of each ensured your footing, but it was the recurved blade that ran from them up to where your foot actually began that gave you the lengthy, loping gallop required of a ponyslave.  Such boots defined you in fact, the Ministry of Improvements having not only adapted you to wearing them, but having done so in a way that made standing flat-footed difficult.  Pure endurance training had provided the rest.

Yet such thoughts are far from your mind as you wait in trembling anticipation, beneath the appalling heat of rural Aekora.  Amongst the lichen fields near the Badlands there was little shade, and your assigned handlers generally kept you from it as a matter of principle.  Your skin is well tanned as a result, amply on display to allow your sweat to run freely.  

[[You bite down on your bit nervously.->Pony4]]


:: Pony4
As always, your bit gives you comfort.  Laminate-padded steel, it is secured firmly between your teeth by the head harness you wear.  Decorative feathers arise from your temples, red colored to match your uniform, while blinders to each side conspire with the posture collar at your throat to ensure you cannot look anywhere but forward.  It kept you, *forced you*, to focus only on marching once the command came.

It does not come yet, however.  Voices behind you talk casually, your handlers for the day discussing their plans.  You merely try to ignore the bit of sweat that runs down your brow, a welcome gust of wind proving so very cool as it tousles your hair.  Like the others the sides of your head have been shaved, leaving a mane that ended in a ponytail and red bow at your mid-back.  

A bit further down, on your left buttock, was your brand.  The Ministry of Truants’ symbol, the same all in their stable shared, encircling your new name.  Or more precisely, number.  5-6, for Precinct 5, Ponyslave 6.  The same marker is on your garter belt, above your cunt, and stamped on the exterior of each of your blinders.  

[[Your harness shifts slightly, as behind you the cart you’re affixed to is boarded.  You take a deep breath.->Pony5]]


:: Pony5
The heavy piercing at your septum marks your inhalation, filling your lungs in expectation of-- *there!*  To your left a sharp crack sounds suddenly, followed by an excited moan.  That would be your team Lead being whipped, the heavy laminate expertly slipped up between her legs to snap smartly just above her cunt.  The command to march!

Behind you the team’s Wheelers, the stronger of your quartet begin to step forward as you and your Lead do as well.  Leaning into your harness, you trust it to keep you upright as you dig your hooves into the ground for traction.  Getting started was always the hardest after all, but with one lurching step comes another, then another, each growing easier.  

[[Bring your knees up high!->HighStep]]
[[Focus on getting to speed!->LowStep]]


:: HighStep
Knowing what your handlers expected, as soon as you feel the cart moving you shift into a high step, bringing your hooved boot up until your thigh is parallel with the ground.  It is far from the most efficient means of marching, but form mattered as much as function on Torei, and you would have undoubtedly been whipped had you done differently.

Your boots extend your every step, amplifying the power of your stride, but the cart behind remains heavy—even for your team of four.  As Second your job is to merely pay attention to the First at your left, while passing commands to the Wheeler behind you.  All of this could be, and was utterly expected to occur without a spoken word.  Your bit prevented speech of course, but even your handlers need not speak.  Their whip could do the talking.

And talk it does.  The road you march along is paved, but roughly, and occasionally the driver behind notices an upcoming pothole as readily as you do.  Steering takes the form of another lash of the Whip to your Lead.  One upon her left flank meant to turn right, while the opposite was expected if it landed upon the left.  Just how *far* she was to turn was wholly her responsibility.  

As if to test you, a sharp snap sounds to your side, your Lead's left flank.

[[Follow her in turning right.->TestGood]]
[[Follow her in turning left.->TestBad]]


:: LowStep
You may have sought to reach speed before taking proper form, but your driver demanded differently, as evidenced by the sharp crack—and the pain that arcs across your rear.  A correction, not a command, one you endeavor to follow by shifting into a high step immediately,  bringing your hooved boot up until your thigh is parallel with the ground.  It is far from the most efficient means of marching, but form mattered as much as function on Torei.

If whipped on her left, your Lead would shy to her right, turning that direction.  You follow suit, leading to a smooth redirection that the two girls behind follow readily.  The maneuver ensures you avoid a portion of the road that sunk into the ground, but you are not awarded for your work.  Following commands and marching are expected of you, nothing more.  You’re a beast of burden now, denied even speech.  Your handlers only rarely interacted with you directly when on patrol.

“How long do you figure, Sir?”  Comes a voice from behind, one of the two female officers to which you had been assigned today.  Her superior, a male, clearly takes a moment to consider.

“Well, we’re about 64 miles out from the station.  5-3,” your Lead, “and her team always set a good pace.  Do the math… and we’re looking at a good eight, maybe nine hour run.  That’s if we push them, perhaps only give them a singular watering break.  Even so, they will be well lathered by the end.”

His voice turns more directly in your direction.  “Any complaints?"  It could have been cruel, but its not.  Officer Karsis was strict, unyielding even.  But he cared for the ponygirl teams.

Still, an eight hour march, in full tack and harness, with the sun beating down on you?  Surely you have something to say to that.

You turn right, but unfortunately come hip to hip with your Lead, turning in the opposite direction.  She snorts in complaint just as the expected lash lands upon your buttocks, a corrective whipping for having made the mistake.  The sting lingers as you hurriedly change course to your left, an awkward redirection that the two girls behind eventually follow.

:: PonyComplain
You try to speak, to voice your horror at being subjected to such a cruel march.  The bit between your teeth ensures its garbled however, hardly rising over the sharp report of your steel-shod hooves upon the pavement below.  Still you nearly leap into the air as your driver’s whip impacts upon your upper thighs, the pain causing you to bite down hard on the laminate and steel wedged between your teeth.

“You should know by now, 5-6, that you don’t have a say in this,” the man retorts, retaining the warmth of his tone.  “We need to get our detainee back to the station before nightfall, and you will make the run whether you like it or not.  But I know you can do it.”

Officer Karsis' attention evidently drifts away afterward, commands being given to check the detainee in question.  She was the reason you had ventured so far from your station after all, a runaway slave that had attempted to cross out of Aekora in the deep wilderness of its rural lichen farms.  It had taken her nearly a week to make the trek, but all it had achieved were her current heavy bondage, and the long march you are condemned to.

“Very good, girls.  We need to get our detainee back to the station before nightfall,” the man concludes.  “And the team will get us there, they are just trained for just this sort of long haul after all.”

:: PEvent1Good
Knowing that your Lead would shy away from the strike, and thus turn left, you follow suit-- together leading the team in a smooth shift towards the correct path with a fork coming up in the road.  

Your blinders keep your attention forward, of course, but you are still able to make out plenty of the surrounding scenery as your team and cart move down the left-side road.  Such as it is.  The Aekoran frontier devolved into lichen farms, the land too dry to support much else, and thus wide, all but empty plains dominate either side of the road before you.  The occasional moisture collector stands out amongst the brownish-red lichen, but otherwise you have little of interest to gaze upon.

There is only your next high-step to truly consider, and the feeling of sweat building upon your body once more.  Without trees or structures for cover you're utterly exposed.

[[And you still have so long to go.->PonyCount]]


:: PEvent1Bad
5-3, your Lead, stumbles a bit as you turn in opposite directions-- you've made a mistake.  Barely does the realization cross your mind before the whip is applied, Officer Karsis flicking you sharply across the buttocks.  His accuracy is as astounding as it is deeply frustrating, but you have no one to blame but yourself.  Snorting sharply, you focus on turning left before looking again to the road ahead.

The road split again ahead, explaining the need to turn.  You move correctly, assisting 5-3 in a smart adjustment of your route.  

Nevertheless a fresh lash lands upon your flank, joining with several others to your fellow slaves in quick succession.  

"There is a tree ahead," Officer Karsis announces.  "I want a canter for the next hour, so that we can reach it for your break."

It's a double-edged command.  The promise of rest is all you can think of, but as you increase your pace you can feel your legs protesting already.

[[He's running you HARD today.->PonyCount]]


:: PEvent2Bad
The road split again ahead, explaining the need to turn.  You move incorrectly however, breaking your smooth pace as your Lead nearly collides with you.  5-3 snorts in disapproval even as you're whipped for the transgression.

:: PonyEvent3Rest
The space beside the road is gentle enough for your knees, the soil sandy, but your focus is elsewhere anyway.  You continue to pant heavily as the ache in your thighs and calves burns freely.  Other pains, like that in your shoulders or restrained arms, is secondary to the exquisite agony of a long march.  Your only solace is the moment given to rest, even if it is beneath the sun above, and that your team shared the same.  

Compared to your tired, sweating, panting, utterly restrained form the two female Officers appear in your limited field of view beneath the shade of the tree.  They're chatting idly, stretching a bit.  One even yawns.

[[As your superiors, they're allowed the luxury.->PonyRest2]]
[[It's not fair!->PonyRest2]]
[[Moan quietly.->PonyRest2]]


:: PonyRest2
They ignore you, regardless.  Officer Karsis could have instructed them to see about handling your team, but as he often did he instead appears to be doing it himself.  As always he begins with your Lead, his shadow visible from your blindered position but little else as he kneels down.  Presumably 5-3's gag is removed, you hear water dribbling onto the ground followed by quiet speech.  How was she doing?  How was the pace?  Questions reserved for the Lead alone.  

Your turn follows soon after, the laminate-uniformed man kneeling before you with an apologetic smile.  One hand holds a large water bottle while the other slides beneath your chin, merely lifting it to meet your gaze.  The shadow of a beard cannot hide the kindness in his eyes.

Joining Euphoria in reverence, you bend over.  Lacking your Superior’s cloak you instead flare out your gloved hands, while ensuring your legs are properly spread.  By the time you have matched her position your habit hangs down to either side of your head.  

A moment passes, then two, in silence.  Your veil prevents you from seeing anything but the booted feet of the Master before you, as well as Euphoria’s heeled counterparts.  Neither move.  Eventually a full minute passes, and concern wells in your throat.  Were you supposed to do something more?

“Sister Euphoria,” he greets, an accent twisting each word ever so slightly.  “A pleasure, as always.  You may rise, as may your Sister.  I would have an introduction.  She is the new one you spoke of?  The impatience of youth, I see.”  You sense displeasure in that last portion.

“I met her briefly upon arrival,” the man replies.  “And she is well trained, truly.  Which means I suspect she likes anyone willing to play with her pussy.”

Just before your collar shocks you, *hard.*  You bite down on your hidden ring gag, back arching in reflex as the pain courses through you.  The experience is not long, but it is intense indeed.  When it relents you look up, only to find Corinth already standing.

“Sorry, Cici… but you should know I’m Mistress’ girl first, and not yours.  When I tell her you tried to get me to let you cum, I know she will reward me… and punish you.  But you deserve it, don’t you?  You *know* the rules.”

Like any good Torean-born household, the bed itself is the focal point, large in size and featuring numerous steel fasteners along its heavy frame and canopy.  Those could be used for all manner of restraints, including full suspension, but for now they sit empty.  

The base of the bed concerns you more however, as you look upon your secondary cage—similar in most functions to the one you woke up in, but this one was retained for special uses.  Usually rewards... or punishments, as the device occupying most of it now suggests.  (if: $SubBetray is true)[As the soubrette had teased,](else:)[Rewards had been promised, but even you’re surprised by] the heavy pneumatic device slotted into the rear of the cage, mechanical and imposing.

You make one last attempt for mercy.  Turning to Alexandra, you moan and plead, pressing up against her as you fight your bondage—wishing you could do more.  Your Mistress is not immune to your charms, in fact it almost seems to sadden her.  “Do not make this harder than it need be,” she sighs, pushing you away and back towards the cage.  “You *must* be taught this lesson.

And taught you are.  Guided into the cage you do eventually take your position, as indicated.

It takes a bit more fiddling, and twice more you moan lewdly, but eventually the piston-mounted cock hilts itself within you.  “I must test it, to ensure you can take it all night,” Alexandra explains, as always putting your safety—if not comfort or feelings—first.  The result is the sweet, heady sensation of the cock pulling out from you.  Once only the tip remains inside it suddenly plunges in again, and you nearly cum right there.

“Your collar and rainbow implants will be engaged… now,” your Mistress notes, standing back up to circle around to your front again.  “They are set to strict denial and synced with the machine.  It will fuck you until the very brink of orgasm… and then deny you.  Over and over… but that is not all.”

Pulling against your restraints does little, the bondage as heavy as it is total.  Only your head can move with some freedom, but you cannot avoid when your Mistress holds the bottle before the cage and sprays you—directly in the face.

The effect is nearly immediate.  Torean slave feed may have been uniform, consistent, but it was common practice to introduce additives catered to each slave.  To yours a strong pheromone was added, one that induced intense and inescapable ecstasy.  But it was dormant, merely lurking in your bloodstream until activated… by that small spray bottle.

You moan immediately, wriggling in your restraints as your legs try to close, to come together.  But you cannot move, cannot reach your suddenly burning cunt, cannot shove the cock any further into your slickened hole.  Any sense of dignity that remained to you, anything that resemble rational thought or effort leaves you.  In that short moment you’re reduced to an animal in intense heat, your own cunt the very center of your universe.  And you cannot do anything but moan, brows upturned, biting against your gag in total and inexorable helplessness.

She stands, and behind you the machine engages.  The cock buried within you pulls out, inch by enraptured inch.  Your horomone-addled body can hardly track it, synapses burn the feeling into one elongated experience—that ends with a **bang** as the cock is suddenly drilled into you.

You would have cummed there, immediately and with force, but your collar and rainbow array intervene.  The first shocks you sharply, the latter temporarily numbing your sensual nerves.  Instead of rocketing off the cliff of climax you’re left, damningly, teetering on the edge before sliding back down.  A moan slips your lips, utterly unbidden, as your very womb aches for that orgasm you had been denied.  

Yet you’ve hardly come to terms with the betrayal of your own body before it happens again, the cock shifting, your cunt dripping with ecstatic agony—only to be denied again.  And again, and again…

You had reached climax, then rocketed off it—the phallus having paused fully hilted inside as you quiver in glorious rapture.  Yet as soon as the afterglow hits, finding you panting in your bondage, the cock begins again.  You don’t think it possible, but the pheromones and your Torean libedo rise immediately to the challenge.  How many times will you cum tonight?  Forty times?  A hundred?

If you manage to catch it, perhaps tomorrow I will use this machine on your pussy.”

Corinth leans back into the plush material of the booth, glancing out at Club Lush before returning her attention to you alone.  “You probably know better than I that Torei sort of functions on… arousal, right?  Because natural-born Toreans just can’t seem to stop thinking about sex, and all that.  If we’re to stay here on Torei, I thought it best we be able to keep up.  So at the Ministry of Improvements I had your libido, your sex drive, increased to Torean levels.  It was just a shot, actually.  Can you believe that?  You will need a booster in a few weeks, and a supplement most slave feed provides, but that’s it.  Expect to be… pretty horny going forward.”

“You do?”  One of her brows rises, her lips screwing together.  She takes a harder look at you, staring down her nose and thus the glasses seated upon them.  What she comes to clearly doesn’t please her.

“Well, right.  Let us… just go over the basics, at least?  Jog that memory.  You’ve always been full of questions, after all.  They could not have trained that out of you at the Academy.”

Corinth leans back into the plush material of the booth, glancing out at Club Lush before returning her attention to you alone.  “You probably know better than I that Torei sort of functions on… arousal, right?  Because natural-born Toreans just can’t seem to stop thinking about sex, and all that.  If we’re to stay here on Torei, I thought it best we be able to keep up.  So at the Ministry of Improvements I had your libido, your sex drive, increased to Torean levels.  It was just a shot, actually.  Can you believe that?  You will need a booster in a few weeks, and a supplement most slave feed provides, but that’s it.  Expect to be… pretty horny going forward.”

The thought clearly amuses her.

[[“This is… how I’m always going to feel?”->ExamFeel]]
[[“Wait, you said ‘it is best WE be able to keep up’?”->ExamWe]]
[[“Can this be reversed?”->ExamReverse]]


:: ExamFeel
“Yep,” Corinth replies, readily.  “Kind of explains Torei, doesn’t it?  If everyone feels that way, almost all the time… *and* everyone is in laminate?  We’re not really in a position to throw stones or whatever, but still.  Couldn’t blame them anyway.”

She shrugs a bit, her bared shoulders and the arousal in question making the simple gesture almost alluring.  “That was just the first improvement I made to you, of course.”

[[“Wait, you said ‘it is best WE be able to keep up’?”->ExamWe]]
[[“Can this be reversed?”->ExamReverse]]
[["What about those other improvements?"->ExamOther]]


:: ExamWe
“Oh, ha—good catch,” your Mistress chuckles.  Looking down at herself, as if taking in what Torei had done to her, her smile only widens as she eventually gestures towards herself with both hands.  “I had the same boosters applied.  Of a lesser grade, to keep things more rational.  But still.  A Mistress has expectations as well.”

Her teeth gleam as she bares them, the smile turning predatory.  “And of course it helps justify keeping a concubine slave, doesn’t it?  Especially one with all the different improvements I made to her.”

[[“This is… how I’m always going to feel?”->ExamFeel]]
[[“Can this be reversed?”->ExamReverse]]
[["What about those other improvements?"->ExamOther]]


:: ExamReverse
“It can,” Corinth notes, shrugging.  “Stopping the supplements would keep you from reaching the highest of the highs, so to speak.  And full reversal would require another shot, or some such, I’m sure.  Torei biomedical skill is incredible after all.  But why are you worrying about that?  Don’t you *want* to be the slut?”

[[“I do, Mistress!”->RevBest]]
[[“…yes.”->RevMid]]
[[“No, Corinth!”->RevLow]]


:: ExamOther
“Oh, well those are more obvious mostly.  The Academy did some work, as you know, but I want you to be the very best concubine you can!  And that means filling out your dresses, and lingerie, and harnesses juuuuuuust right, you know?”

Her enthusiasm is almost infectious.  As is the way she stares, taking in the sight of you in tight red laminate. 

[[“I do… fill things out more, yes.”->ExamFill]]
[[“Why is my hair red?->ExamHair]]


:: RevBest
Sticking her tongue out, Corinth laughs.  “Knew it.  That’s why I made the other improvements too.”

[[“This is… how I’m always going to feel?”->ExamFeel]]
[[“Wait, you said ‘it is best WE be able to keep up’?”->ExamWe]]
[["What about those other improvements?"->ExamOther]]


:: RevMid
Sticking her tongue out, Corinth laughs.  “Knew it.  This is Torei, babe.  No reason to be *too* ashamed about it.  That’s why I made the other improvements too.”

[[“This is… how I’m always going to feel?”->ExamFeel]]
[[“Wait, you said ‘it is best WE be able to keep up’?”->ExamWe]]
[["What about those other improvements?"->ExamOther]]


:: RevLow
“Mmm…” Corinth regards you for a long moment before her eyes end up resting on your collar.  “I’m not sure that is totally true, and as a collared slave you don’t exactly have a choice in the matter… or any of the other improvements, either.”

[[“This is… how I’m always going to feel?”->ExamFeel]]
[[“Wait, you said ‘it is best WE be able to keep up’?”->ExamWe]]
[["What about those other improvements?"->ExamOther]]


:: ExamFill
“You *do*,” Corinth enthuses.  “The Ministry does good work, don’t they?”

Looking down, you have to at least cede that point.  The swell of your chest and hips is more pronounced now, but still natural looking.  For what amounted to surgery on most worlds, there is no evidence of it having occurred mere hours earlier.

“I know it will take some time for you to get used to,” she continues, as your eyes meet again.  “But… you look great, babe.  I know that dress was literally made for you, given how Wardrobes work, but I still mean it when I say you rock it!”

[[“Why is my hair red?->ExamHair]]
[[“Can we talk about the dress?->ExamDress]]


:: ExamHair
“I’m a sucker for a red-haired girl,” Corinth states simply, before her trademark smile arises again.  “I mean it!  But I do have another reason.  Did you know red hair isn’t naturally Torean?  Something about their genetics.  Traditionalists don’t care for it, I’ve been told.  Which is also why I chose it.  I’m *not* Torean, neither are you.  Why not flaunt it?”

Two of the fingers on her hand point towards you, then move in a tight circle.  “And, you know, if I’m going to own a slave I should at least get to pick her hair color!  Just like I picked the dress.”

[[“You adjusted my measurements.”->ExamFill]]
[[“Can we talk about the dress?->ExamDress]]


:: ExamDress
The dress in question, rendered wholly in glossy laminate with a longer tail and a deep slit that exposed your thigh readily upon standing certainly was notable.  Corinth takes in the sight as your hands come together upon the table between you, the opera length gloves matching everything else in shade.  Unlike the strangers that surrounded you however, only she could know about the extensive lingerie beneath.

“What do you mean?”  Your Mistress asks.

[[“I just wanted to say that I love it, Corinth!”->DressLove]]
[[“Its just not what I expected a slave would wear.->DressExpect]]
[[“Actually, can I ask about something else?->CorDate]]


:: DressLove
“I hoped you would!” Corinth replies, reaching across the table to interlock her fingers with your own.  Both of you are gloved, you in red her in black, the colors intermingling.  “I had some of my old clothing, offworld textiles and the like, shipped here while you were at the Academy.  Just incase I needed them.  But you… you will be wearing laminate, only, going forward.  Dresses and bras, corsets and garters… they trained you on heels too, at the Academy?  Right?”

[[“Extensively.->DressLove2]]


:: DressExpect
“Why is that?  Torei has all sorts of slaves, and all sorts of owners.  And there is nothing odd about a favored concubine being taken out on the town, in a glossy dress!  You should count yourself lucky some lichen farmer didn’t buy you, put you in a full enclosure suit all day working their fields.  Although now that I say it, you would probably like that I’m thinking… ah, nevermind.  What I mean to say is that I’ll keep you however I like, and I *like* you in this way right now.”

She pauses to take a sip from her glass, but smiles over the rim before actually drinking.  “And its not the only thing you’re wearing, is it?”

[[“It is not, Mistress!”->DressExpect2]]
[[“You mean… the undergarments?”->DressExpect2]]


:: DressLove2
“*Wonderful,*” Corinth gleefully smiles.  “The expectation that a woman, much less a slave, need almost always be heeled was probably the hardest bit for me to adapt to.  My poor toes, those first few weeks and months.  But you know what I’m talking about, and I hope you’d agree that the way it improves one’s posture and the overall look… well, I’ve come to find out it is hard to go wrong with stilettos!”

[[“Its just not what I expected a slave would wear.->DressExpect]]
[[“Actually, can I ask about something else?->CorDate]]


:: DressExpect2
She meant the bra and panties beneath, both of which integrated into a two part body harness focused on chest and hips respectfully.  That the Wardrobe had managed such intricacy without breaking the smooth lines of the dress atop them is a testament to Torean engineering.  Likewise, the fact that it had been a recommended addition for “submissive personalities” spoke to just how well Torei knew those who would be wearing such.

“We will get to that,” Corinth promises.

[[“I just wanted to say that I love it, Corinth!”->DressLove]]
[[“Actually, can I ask about something else?->CorDate]]


:: FeedAsk
“You most certainly do,” Corinth replies sharply.  “You had better get use to it, babe.  If you’re good perhaps I’ll allow you some proper food, but what you have before you is the standard for most Torean slaves.  Enough nutrition in a single meal to keep you going for the day, and that’s important.  I intend to make sure you keep to a good diet, and good exercise.  I want you as healthy as you can be.”

[[Healthy, but not particularly happy when it came to feeding time it seems.->CorAskDinner]]


:: FeedNo
Corinth’s eyes narrow, not angry but sizing you up.  The black of her brows and the sharp lines of her raven bangs conspire to make it a rather intimidating look.  “Yes you will.”

[[She’s not giving you a choice.->CorAskDinner]]


:: Feed1
Taking up your spoon, you test the proverbial waters by dipping it into the waiting Feed.  Much like porridge or oatmeal it is liquid, but viscous.  Never having looked appetizing, the way your spook slowly slides into the gruel hardly furthers the prospect.

It certainly doesn’t taste *good*.  Or like much of anything at all.  The lack of flavor is matched to a strange textureless sensation, as if the Feed itself was as glossy and smooth as any piece of laminate clothing.  You’re almost surprised how easily it goes down… and how readily the idea of biting into a proper meal suddenly resonates with you in that moment.
(set: $Strike to 1)
[[Still, you take a few more bites.->CorDate]]


:: CorDinnerEnd
“Well, talk about… well, talking!”  Throwing back the last of her drink, Corinth’s enthusiasm boils over with a bright smile.  She stands, sliding from the booth as she offers her hand.  Her other extends towards the rest of Club Lush, the scene below the VIP balcony as always a riotous affair of laminate.

“Can you dance?”  She asks, only to run over your actual answer.  “Although I guess the better question would be if you remember, right?  Don’t worry about it, babe.  Come on, I’ll show you.  Now that we’ve hashed everything out there is so much I’m ready to show you.”

[[Take her hand.  “Show me, Mistress.”->CorDinnerEnd2]]
[[Take her hand.  “What do you mean?”->CorDinnerEndB]]


:: Feed2
Digging once more into your food, across the table Corinth finishes her drink.  Tapping in her order on the console between you, another is delivered in short order by a uniformed slave.  You met Cherish months ago, and while this one isn’t her the outfit is the same—as is the Club’s means of compelling them to do good work.  When Corinth presses another button the slave is treated to a bit of vibration from her piercing, her thighs coming reflexively together.

Afterward she thanks Corinth profusely, withdrawing with her tray.  It is a small taste of everyday Torean life, and far more enjoyable than the mouthful of slave feed you have in that moment.
(set: $Strike to 2)
[[But you take a few more bites, nearly finishing it.->CorDate]]


:: Feed3
Doing your duty once more, you finish off your so-called meal.  The clink of the spoon upon bowl draws Corinth’s attention away from the distant stage, where a band of some sort is performing.  One of the instruments appears to be a slave’s moans induced to produce a rhythm, but your Mistress’ attention overrides that observation.

“Done,” she notes happily.  “Good.  Shall we wrap things up?  Once you’re ready to go, you need only tell me.  The night is still young, and we *do* have other things to do.”
